$$\begin{gather} F_g = F_D = 0
\\ -9.81m/s^2\cdot m+mCv^2 = 0 
\end{gather}$$
Where $C$ is a constant (often based on mass). \

## Example problem: 
An object with mass $m=2kg$ falls vertically through the air, acted on by gravity ($|F|=mg$) and a drag force with magnitude ($|F|=mCv^2$) where $C=0.04$. 

| time | y position | y velocity | y force |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 4.00 | 40.00m     | -10.00m/s  |         |
| 4.01 |            |            |         |
