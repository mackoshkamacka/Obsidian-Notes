Cartesian coordinates describe the x, y and z position of an object (often in Euclidean geometries). However, for non-Euclidean planes, coordinates ($r, \theta, \phi$) Where $r$ is the distance from the point of interest to the origin, a vector, $\vec r$. The variable $\theta$ is the angle between the vector $\vec r$ and the z-axis. The variable $\phi$ is the angle $\vec r$ and the $xy$ plane and the $x$-axis. Note that sometimes, $\phi$ and $\theta$ are swapped. 

$$ \begin{gather}
x^2 + y^2 +z^2 = r^2
\\ x = r\sin \theta \cos \theta 
\\ y = r\sin \theta \sin \theta 
\\ z = r\cos\theta 
\end{gather} $$
