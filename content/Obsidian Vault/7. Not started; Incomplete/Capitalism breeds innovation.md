“Capitalism breeds innovation critique: {a. Think about all the geniuses who are unable to get an education, die because they can’t afford healthcare, slave away at 9-5s because its their only option etc. Think of how inequality produced by capitalism acts as a barrier to peoples potential. Think about how smart people who are driven by money rather than what they could do for humanity; b. If the goal of production is profit, then innovation will be done olnt insofar as it can bring more profit. Things that could help human beings and society will be blocked or not even sought because the goal is profit. People are also less likely to innovate due to the risk of losing profit or money. If anything, capitalism hinders innovation and when it doesn’t it only innovates for profit. (Which as we always see, isn’t always tied to human well-being.)}”
