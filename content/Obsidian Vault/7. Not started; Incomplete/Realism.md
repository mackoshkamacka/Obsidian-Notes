## Colloquial 
Representing familiar things in a way that is accurate or true to life. 

"Looks realistic" - Video games/CGI - Uncanny valley and near impossible dialogue 
"Characters act like real people" - A Quintin Tarantino film has specific, purposeful dialogue, whereas people in real life stutter, miscommunicate and repeat themselves 
"realism as a story" - Life does not fit into a neat 3 act structure 
"Historical and geographical accuracy" - Often boring and would need to be sensationalized.  
"Like real people" Often characters are under extreme stress, in unrealistic situations that do not reflect the average person. 

Should we try to make things realistic: there is an issue with universalization of a 'reality,' due to qualia, thus attempts at such a universally true art is nearly impossible. Often attempts at realism have baked in prejudices. 

Disconnect with [[Media representation]] and 'realistic' - [[CSI Effect]], legitimizes racism, sexism etc. Alloy outrage on Twitter. Black ariel. Black people in historical media. 

Grittiness in media feels reel because "The universe in which we live is somehow a universe of dead conventions and artificiality  so the only authentic real experience must be some extremely violent, shattering experience." [[Slavoj Žižek]] = a response to safe media (often child media), 9/11, War, Housing Crisis - Built on a specific view of masculinity; sanitizes the military (superhero movies, Top Gun, cop shows, clean justified war) This is the [[American monomyth]]
