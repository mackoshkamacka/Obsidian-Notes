### Nodes and Antinodes: 
Positions along the wave which are fixed are called nodes (minimum) and those with the largest displacement are called antinodes (maximum).
For standing waves, the distance between adjacent nodes = the distance between adjacent antinodes = Î»/2.

Standing waves (stationary) waves result from the superposition of two opposite waves which are otherwise identical.
Energy is not transferred by standing waves.

#### Pipes 
Air particles can oscillate and create standing waves in pipes with open or closed ends.
Antinodes are positioned at open ends and nodes are positioned at closed ends.
Standing waves on a string is equivalent to that in a pipe which is closed on both ends (nodes-node).
The following table summarizes the behavior of standing waves in pipes and strings:
