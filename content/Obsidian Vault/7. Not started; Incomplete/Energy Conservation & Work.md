For any physical system in an environment with time translation [symmetry][Symmetry (physics)], there is a quantity called energy that is unchanging in time. 

Energy is a single, scalar value; can come in different forms; 

#### Kinetic Energy 
Energy associated with the motion of an object: 
$$E_{kinetic} =E_k = \frac 1 2 m \vec v ^2$$
Where $E_k$ is the kinetic energy, $m$ is the mass, and $v$ is the velocity = $v_x^2+ v_y^2+ v_z^2$ and is small compared to the speed of light $3.00\times 10^8 m/s$. The exact formula for kinetic energy as speed nears the speed of light is. 
$$E = [\frac 1 {\sqrt{1 - \frac {v^2}{c^2}}}]mc^2$$
##### Thermal Energy 
Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of the random motions of molecules 
##### Sound Energy 

### Work 
Work is the net energy transferred to an object by some force. 
$$W = \vec F\cdot \delta \vec x = F_{||}\delta x$$
Where $W$ is work, $\vec F$ is the net force, $F_{||}$ is the component of $\vec F$ in the direction of motion, and $\delta x$ is the distance travelled. Note that $F_x\delta x+F_y\delta y+F_z\delta z$. 
#### Potential Energy 
Potential energy is the energy associated with the configuration of a system (locations of its parts)
##### Gravitational Potential 
$$
\begin{gather}
W= F_{||}\cdot \delta x 
\\ W = mg\cdot \delta x
\\ E=mgh
\end{gather}
$$
Where $E_g$ is the gravitational potential energy, $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is the gravitational constant (for small masses on Earth at distances one Earth radius away), and $h$ is the height 
##### Elastic Potential 
$$
\begin{gather}
 W= F_{||}\cdot \delta x 
\\ W = -\frac 1 2kx\cdot x
\\ E =- \frac 1 2 kx^2 
\end{gather}
$$
Step 2: comes from the average force exerted on the spring; or the sum of smaller infinitesimally small compressions in x (integrate force as a function of compression
