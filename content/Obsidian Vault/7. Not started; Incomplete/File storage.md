In order to save space, compression is used → lossy and lossless (as well as ZIP files)
* Lossy = some info lost, lossless = no info lost (just records patterns)
* An algorithm = step by step instructions
* An algorithm is when a computer takes an element of a variable or other piece of information, manipulating this information to follow a set of instructions.
* Pseudocode = An outline of how a problem given should be solved. (crashes and loading screens are sometimes attributed to unaccounted possibilities)
* Functions: Actions/verbs that solve smaller problems
* Conditionals: Based off of some qualities, specific functions must be executed.
* Boolean expressions: True/False
* Loops: A sequence of code that
