1. Understand a systematic design process.

- This is demonstrated by being able to write programs for a reasonably complex task, where the ability to use the "one task - one function" rule can be demonstrated.

3. Understand that programs are written both to run on computers and for people to read.

- This is demonstrated by being able to write code that is readable, well organized, documented, and tested.

5. Understand the relation between information and data.

- This is demonstrated by being able to design the data representation for a reasonably complex problem, and to describe the information encoded in the given data.

7. Understand that the structure of the data a program operates on determines many elements of the program's structure.

- This is demonstrated by being able to identify correspondences between a data definition and a program that operates on that data. Also by being able to identify how potential changes to a data definition would affect a program.

9. Understand that one can replace repetitive code with an abstraction in a systematic way. Understand that this is at the heart of designing libraries.

- This is demonstrated by being able to produce examples of code before and after abstraction: before, where one can see the repeated code, and after, where one can see the abstraction and verify that it provides the solution to the original problem, as well as several other similar problems. Students should also be able to design a program that uses existing libraries or existing code to solve a new problem.

11. Understand that programs can be described using notations other than code, and that these models can facilitate program design.

- This is demonstrated by being able to identify correspondences between non-code models of a program and the program itself and by being able to use non-code models in program design.
