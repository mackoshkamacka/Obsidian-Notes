Longtermism = safeguarding the people of the future 

If you have 3 dollars that you can give to a homeless person, but don’t know what they may spend it on, your money is better spent on malaria nets; this EA perspective may be criticized for missing the point of morality. A human being asked you for help and you ignored them. - Response to that is that they have the privilege to ask in the first place.
  
- Lisa Herzog, “Can EA Really Change the World?” in Open Democracy, 

-  Bernard Williams, “Utilitarianism and Moral Self-Indulgence” 

Future people, by definition, do not exist. 

There are people who need help now.

The precipice 

[[Pascal’s mugging]] & [[Non-identity problem]] 

Measurability bias in treating charity as a science experiment; short term charity is more observable and qualifies how beneficial it is compared to the long term reconstruction of financial and political institutions.   

Private foundations; modern philanthropy, (Andrew Carnegie, The Gospel of Wealth) - never question how the money is made, nor change the economic system/political structure, the act of giving is prioritized. 

Slavov Zizek, “Nobody Has To Be Vile” 

The lack of empirical evidence can only be supplemented by business clout; working within a system. - Crypto hype;
  
charities are often run by westerners - Anthony Kalulu, “Effective Altruism is Worse Than Traditional Philanthropy in the way it excludes the extreme poor in the global south”

How do we achieve EA? 
  
Do we strive towards [[Working within a system ]]or [[Dismantling a system]] ?
