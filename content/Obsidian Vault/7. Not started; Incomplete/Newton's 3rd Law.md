Because of the conservation of momentum, 
$$

\Delta \vec p_A=-\Delta \vec p_B
$$
If there is some change in time is taken, $\Delta t$, then,
$$ \begin{gather}
\frac {\Delta \vec p_A}{\Delta t }=\frac {\Delta \vec p_B}{\Delta t }
\\ \vec F_A=-\vec F_B
\end {gather} $$
This relates to the normal force as a consequence of the acceleration due to the applied force. The opposite reaction in the electrostatic repulsion of the atoms forced infinitely close: i.e. if a ball is on a table, the $\vec F_A$ is the gravitational force on the ball, and $-\vec F_B$ is the electrostatic repulsion. (The applied force can be weight, pressing a hand against a wall etc.)

Suppose $\frac F m = t^2$ What is $\Delta v$ from $t_0$ to $t_1$. 
$$\begin{gather}
\frac {dv}{dt}=\frac F m 
\\ \frac {dv} {dt}=t^2
\\ v = \frac {t^3} 3+C
\\ v(t_1)= \frac {t^3} 3+C 
\\ v(t_0)= \frac {t^3} 3+C 
\\ \Delta v = v(t_1)-v(t_0)= \frac {t^3_1} 3- \frac {t^3_0} 3
\end{gather}$$
So generally, if $\frac F m$ is a known function $a (t)$ then, $w$ is a function whose derivative is $a$. However, there is another method to solving the same problem in [[Area method for predicting velocities]].  The equivalence between these two methods relates to the fundamental theorem of [[Calculus]]: integration:
