Eugenics is generally defined as the systematic organization of human reproduction such that a particular group does not pass on characteristics seen as undesirable (genetically and culturally). This can include, race, ethnicity, religion, physical and mental ability etc. This pseudoscientific study was largely developed by Sir Francis Galton to “improve the human race.” Eugenics was used to justify genocide, oppression, and systematic elimination.
