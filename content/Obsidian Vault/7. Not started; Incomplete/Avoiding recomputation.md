The general practice of writing code is to write a simple, easy to understand piece of code and worry about computation and time complexity later. Sometimes, the coding language will make certain efficiencies redundant. So it's best to test code on large sets of data to see where computation is taking the longest. Exponential growth is something that must be avoided.
