External influences can change angular momentum. So we can define $\tau$ by the rate of change of angular momentum of some standard object. Depends on how the forces are arranged. 

For a force acting at some location, the torque is 
$$\tau = F_{\perp}|\vec r| \ \ \ \ \ or \ \ \ \ \ \tau |\vec r ||\vec F|\sin \theta$$ ![[Pasted image 20241104114533.png]]


$$\begin{gather} \tau_{net} = \frac {dL}{dt} 
\\ 
\end{gather} $$
