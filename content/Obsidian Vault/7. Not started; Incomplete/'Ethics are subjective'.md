"People have different views on ethical issues" - What actions emerge from these actions? 
- Suppose there was a school shooter who shot a bunch of people and then said, "I don't think I did anything wrong - it wasn't wrong to me to shoot all those people"
By assuming that ethics are subjective, as long as the party earnestly believes what they are doing is right, their actions can never be universally wrong. 

[['Ethics are relative]]
