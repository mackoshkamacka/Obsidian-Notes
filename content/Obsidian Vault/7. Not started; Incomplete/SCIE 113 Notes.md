*Intro discussion: Why is it important for scientists to share their research with the public:* 
- Pros = Improvement, prevent abuse of knowledge (public accountability), ethical/government regulation, broader progress - build on others' research, expose other POVs, generational/basic knowledge, transparency + accountability (Harvard and Stanford scandals)
- Cons = Scientific jargon - communication, classism, used as a political tool, easy misinformation = must be handled carefully, misinformation = crypto,  

MOST
- Understanding other stars ultimately allows us to gain a better understanding of our home planet and home star. 
- Fundraising is rocket science
- Legacy of research propagates as the metaphorical children in derivative research efforts 

Claims = A statement that asserts something that may be true or false, and so must be supported
- Significant = challenges the status quo 
- Specific
- Clear, concise
- Focus, on one central idea 
- Debatable, and worth debating 
Reason: A statement that supports the claim
E.g. an interpretation of evidence, or inferences from observations
