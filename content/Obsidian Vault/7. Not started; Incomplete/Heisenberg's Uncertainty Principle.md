*One cannot know precisely (with zero uncertainty) both the position and momentum of a microscopic particle at the same time*

$$\Delta x\Delta p \ge\frac h {4 \pi} $$
Where $\Delta x$ is the position of the particle, $\Delta p$ is the momentum of the particle, and $h$ is Planck's constant, $6.626\times 10 ^{-34} Js$.
