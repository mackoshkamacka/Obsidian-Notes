"These leaders that they call leaders ... these included comedians these included comics, trumpet players, baseball players, show me where in the white community a comedian is a white leader, show me where in the white community a singer is a leader or a dancer or a trumpet player is a white leader. These aren't leaders they are puppets and clowns that have been set up by the white community over the black community and have been made celebrities and usually say exactly what they know what the white man wants to hear. Usually black people know that the bourgoise black are not fulfilling their truest self - they are only fulfilling the intentions of what the white man. And any new information that the bourgoise black get is for them to relay to the rest of the black community. "
