## Razors 
A razor is a general principle or rule of thumb that allows one to eliminate unlikely explanations of some phenomenon/avoid unnecessary actions. These were made into subpages so they could be referenced in other pages. 

[[Adler's razor]] = If it isn't observable, it's not worth talking about.  
[[Einstein's razor]] = Make things as simple as possible but no simpler = perspective on Occam's razor.
[[Grice's razor]]= Be brief in semantic explanations = variation on Occam's razor + contextual meaning > definition. 
[[Halon's razor]] = Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. 
[[Hitchens' Razor]] = If something can be asserted without evidence, it can be dismissed without evidence. 
[[Hume's guillotine]] = The ought/is problem: just because something is, does not necessarily mean that it should be. (investigate further)
[[Occam's Razor]] = The fewer assumptions the better: less edge cases/contradictory ad hoc information, the better
[[Popper's falsifiability principle]] = For a theory to be considered scientific it must be falsifiable. 
[[Sagan standard]] = Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
