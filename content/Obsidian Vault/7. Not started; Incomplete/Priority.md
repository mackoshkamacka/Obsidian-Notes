FIFO = First in first out system/priority hierarchy
LIFO = Last in first out system/priority hierarchy
Queues = a FIFO system
Enqueue = add (an item of data awaiting processing) to a queue of such items.
Dequeue = a double ended que, where both the first and last items of a list take the highest priority and the middle takes the least.
