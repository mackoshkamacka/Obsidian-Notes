A positive sum game refers to situations in which the total gains and losses is greater than zero. A positive sum occurs when resources are somehow increased and an approach is formulated in which  the desires and needs of all are considered and satisfied. That is to say that one does not need to be put down to better another's position. (Win-Win Game)
