## Addition reactions
Addition reactions are reactions wherein alkenes and alkynes have their double bonds broken and new elements are added. There are a few variations of this.
### Hydrogenation
Hydrogenation is the process of adding $H_2$ to an alkene: e.g. The general reaction for this is: $C_nH_{2n} + H_2 \to C_nH_{2n+2}$ .

![[1-catalytic-hydrogenation-of-alkenes-to-give-alkanes-1.gif]]
### Halogenation
Halogenation is the process of adding $X_2$ to create an alkyl halide The general reaction for this is: $C_nH_{2n} + X_2\to C_nH_{2n}X_2$.

This is the process for which alkyne and alkene detection works:
With alkynes, this process occurs twice

## Combustion
### Complete
In a complete combustion, there is a rich amount of oxygen; thereby creating $CO_{2(g)}$ and $H_2O_{(g)}/H_2O_{(l)}$ (If the system is closed, then there is water vapor, if the system is closed then liquid water is produced.)
### Incomplete
In an incomplete reaction there is a deficiency in oxygen, creating $CO_{2(g)}, H_2O_{(g)} +CO_{(g)} +C_{(s)}$ . Where $C_{(s)}$ is soot/coke/a pure form of carbon.

# Polymers
Polymerization is the formation of very large molecules from many small units, monomers. Wherein a monomer is a single ‘unit,’ dimer is composed of two units, trimer is composed of three units, and polymers are composed of several units.

Polymers can have a variety of unique physical and chemical properties. Examples include: (Synthetic) plastic, nylon and Kevlar; (natural) proteins (amino acids), carbohydrates (starch, cellulose, etc.), DNA, spider thread.
## Addition polymers
Addition polymers are a result of linking alkenes through addition polymerization. The double bond is broken; allowing for carbon to have two more free bonds. When this occurs on a large scale, the free bonds of one alkene bond with another; creating long strands of polymers.

## Condensation polymers
Condensation polymers are always result in the polymer and a small extra molecule, $HOH$. Esterification is a type of condensation reaction. Catalysts for his reaction are $H_2SO_{4(aq)}$ and heat.

### Important Symbols (Curly Arrows)
A ‘full’ movement is equivalent to 2 electrons moving, and is signified with an arrow with ‘hooks’ (curly arrow) on both ends.
A ‘half’ movement is equivalent to 1 electron moving, and is signified with a ‘hooked’ (fish-hook) arrow

![[lotgf.jpg]]
### 3 Electron movement scenarios
1. A lone pair of electrons moving towards electrons in a bond: E.g. The lone pair of electrons on an oxygen atom moving to the positive part of a degree 3 carbon, forming a coordinate covalent bond.
   ![[sed.png]]
2. A pair of electrons in a bond going towards a lone pair of electrons: E.g. A \sigma bond moving towards the lone pair of electrons of a chlorine atom. - Forcing the two to separate. ![[sdfsdfsa.png]]
3. A pair of electrons in a bond moving to another bond. E.g. The electrons in a double bond moving to some hydro-halide; forming a single bond with a hydrogen, forming a chlorine ion, and having it bond to the now positive, formerly double bonded carbon.![[oiufdsa.png]]
* A lone pair to lone pair does not occur. 
## Bond cleavage
### Heterolytic fission
Heterolytic fission is where both electrons in the bond go to either $X$ or $Y$ (based on typical ionic charges), to form $X^-$ and $Y^+$ (or $X^+$ and $Y^-$).

![[155f2e7d1e5e2ffbd0ea31881ff848a1.webp]]
### Homolytic fission
Homolytic fission is where one electron goes to both species $X$ and $Y$.
$X$ and $Y$ then become highly reactive radicals. E.g. $Cl_2 \to 2Cl$.

![[ttttttt.jpg]]
## Free Radical Substitution
Free radical substitution can be seen in reactions such as halogenation and substitutions of alkanes:
$$ CH_4+Cl_2 \ \frac {UV \ or \ heat}{\to} \ CH_3Cl + H-Cl $$
### Step 1 - Initiation:
Heat or UV light causes the weaker bonds in the halogen to undergo homolytic fission. Two radicals are produced.
### Step 2.i - Propagation:
The halogen radical abstracts (steals) a hydrogen to form $HCl$ and an alkyl radical (methyl radical).
### Step 2.ii:
The alkyl radical will abstract a chlorine atom to form the product and a new chlorine radical continuing the cycle. The other chlorine radical can then participate in 2.i.
### Step 3 - Termination:
Various reactions between radicals allow for the formation of the final products and ends the radical cycle by ‘removing’ radicals from the system/cycle.

# Nucleophilic Substitution
Nucleophilic substitution occurs through one of two mechanisms: $S_N1$ and $S_N2$. The mechanism is dependent on structures of the reactants, the solvent. Where $S$ stands for substitution, $N$ stands for nucleophilic, $1$ is for unimolecular, and $2$ is for bimolecular.

A nucleophilic substitution involves:
- A nucleophile, a nucleus seeking molecule $:Nu$
- A substrate (electrophile), a molecule that is being reacted with (must have a polar $C$ bond * The carbon must be have a slightly positive dipole, $\delta ^+$).
- A leaving group - the material that is being substituted (in general, the more polar this is, the better it acts a leaving group).
## Nucleophiles
1. Larger elements are stronger nucleophiles than smaller elements, since they have less attraction to their electrons (this relates to the atomic distance and shielding of electrons). $HS^- \ > \ OH^- \ \| I^- > Br^-$
2. The more electronegative the nucleophilic atom the weaker the nucleophile: $CH_3I \ > \ CH_3Br \ > \ CH_3Cl \ > \ CH_3F$
### Examples
Good : $I^-, HS^-, RS^- \ | \ Br^-, HO^-, RO^-, NC^-, N_3^- \ | \ NH_3, Cl^-, F^- \ | \ H_2O, ROH$ : Bad
### Strength
The strength of a nucleophile is determined by the rate it reacts with an alkyl halide. - A strong nucleophile reacts fast, a poor nucleophile reacts slowly.
### Trends
1. Negative ions are stronger nucleophiles than neutral ones: $OH^- > HOH \ \| \ NH_2^-> NH_3\ \| \ RO^- \ > \ ROH$

### Mechanism
Recall that in an $sp^3$ hybridized orbital there is a large lobe where the bond forms and a small lobe on the opposite side (antibonding).

In $S_N2$ mechanism, the $Nu:$ will attack the backside of the $sp^3$ orbital that is bonded to the leaving group.

The carbon temporarily is bonded to both the $Nu:$ and the leaving group in a transition state.

In this mechanism, there is an inversion of the molecular configuration.

These reactions happen at different rates for different substrates: $1\degree >>2\degree >>>3 \degree$, where $3\degree$ happens so slowly, it is negligible. This is because $1 \degree$substrates have a less electron dense backside, allowing for better attacks.

### $S_N2$ Examples:

|Nucleophile|Strong nucleophile|Weak nucleophiles|/|
|Rate|Step 1: Leaving group leaves (slow) Step 2: Nu: attack (fast)|/|/|
|Leaving group|Good leaving group|/|Poor leaving group|
### Steric Hinderance
Bulky alkyl groups makes it very difficult for $:Nu$ to attack the electrophiles.
### Mechanism
![[rvdsdsffdsf.png]]
Rate = $k[R-X]$

Rate = $k[substrate]$

In $S_N1$, an intermediate is formed when the leaving group is in the substrate leave spontaneously. The carbocation intermediate can exist for an observable/significant period of time. The solvent is important for stabilizing both the leaving group and the carbocation

There must be a really good leaving group

This creates a racemic mixture where there is no optical activity.
## Leaving Groups
In both $S_N1$ and $S_N2$, there is a difference in the rate based on the leaving group.
### Bond enthalpies
To compare leaving groups, bond enthalpies indicate the amount of energy required for the leaving group to break off.
1. Iodo ($C-I = 228kJ/mol$) = fastest leaving group
2. Bromo ($C-Br=285kJ/mol$)
3. Chloro ($C-Cl=324kJ/mol$)
4. Flouro ($C-F =492kJ/mol$) = slowest leaving group
### Other leaving groups
Separately, $TsO^-, NH_3 \ | \ I^-, H_2O, \ | \ Br^- \ | \ Cl^- \ | \ F^- \ | OH^-, NH_2^-, RO^-$ are considered to be excellent leaving groups to poor leaving groups in ascending order.
## $S_N1$ vs. $S_N2$
When compared to $S_N2$, $S_N1$ is considered (by IB*) to be faster because they are ‘unimolecular’ and are only dependent on 1 molecule to occur, whereas $S_N2$ requires more than one species.
# Electrophilic Addition
Reactants are classified as electrophiles or nucleophiles. In general, electrophilic addition is the process of a double bond turning into a single bond with some other diatomic molecule added.

![[eeeeeee.png]]

1. $H^+$ (electrophile) is attracted to the $\pi$ bond of the alkene.
2. The electron in the $\pi$ bond reaches out and creates a covalent bond with the $H^+$.
3. This then breaks the bond between $H-Br$
4. Since the $C$ and new $H$ uses two electrons to forma bond, the other carbon is now electron deficient, turning into a carbocation.
5. The carbocation is an extremely attractive electrophilic substance to $Br^-$, nucleophile.

## Markovnikov’s Rule

“The thing carbon that has more hydrogens is more likely to bond with the hydrogen of a hydro-halogen. This is because the carbon that is bonded to more electron rich branches tend to be more stable, thus less likely to be a cation.

- This applies to asymmetric reagents and asymmetric alkenes.
- The electropositive part of the reagent bonds to the carbon of the double bond that has a greater amount of hydrogens attached. - The stability of the carbocation intermediate.
- The less saturated carbons, form more stable carbocations, giving the nucleophile a chance to attack the electrophile.
- The inductive effect is where the electron density of the other alkyl chains stabilize the carbocation. Think if this as an orchestra compensating for a missing member, and getting away with it vs. having a missing solo, as in a primary carbon.

![[Markovnikovs-Rule-1-700x253.png]]

The major product is the Markovnikov product, and the Minor product is the Anti-Markovnikov product. The two species produced from electrophilic addition form regiorisomers.
