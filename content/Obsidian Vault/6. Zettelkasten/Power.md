[[Corruptible: Who Gets Power and How it Changes Us]] 

One of the major issues in modern society is the tendency of people who seek power to attain it purely for the means of controlling and manipulating people. Not for any motivated reason, rather the goal of such people is acquire more power - not as a means of reaching an objective but as sustenance. 

The hunger that drives individuals with an affinity for power acquisition often leads to the wrong people in the positions of power, superficial hierarchies forming such as [[Pink flamingos home owners association]], power structures that are abused, and the wrong people in leadership positions.

Often systems advertise themselves to individuals who don't necessarily make the best leaders. Take politics for instance, privacy of politicians are often intruded and is a socially volatile industry. Despite this, people still fill the occupation despite the negatives - which people would sacrifice their personal lives, privacy and often their morals for what? If this is a profession that is built on selling [[Misinformation]], [[Selective information]] or at the very least [[Simple truths]] and is notorious for corruption as well as servicing self interests what kind of person would willingly seek influence in this field. The kinds of people that are willing to lie, take advantage of [[Ethos]], [[Nationalism]], [[Dogma]] and other mechanisms of ulterior manipulation to serve their own interests (often in misalignment with what would be 'best' for the people). It isn't hard to believe that the kinds of people that this would attract would be adept at deceit and selfishly motivated. However, there is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to advocate for civil issues, speaking out, and forward change in all walks of life. But the power that comes with being a politician is often more captivating than any of the aforementioned opportunities opened through the power of a politician. Although this is merely one instance of how power structures that are made to attract people who seek to instigate change, it is indicative of how power structures can be abused and why the wrong individuals have or desire [[Pure influence]].   

A major reason for a disproportionate amount of power hunger people controlling a large portion of our societies is largely due to the fact that attaining power comes with highly unattractive consequences. Where in order for the average person to make headway would nessecitate a cost that the average person would not be willing to make.  

Feeding into its inaccessiblity, people victim to marginalization simply have less oppotunity and insentive to pursue [["Success"]]. Giving rise to the snowy peaks problem.
