Anthropocentrism (human supremacy) is the belief that human beings are naturally better than all other forms of life. This entails that non-human beings are just means to human ends. This is a contrasting view to the relatively new [[Environmentalism]]

This human hubris, lends to the forcing nature into an [[Other]] position; something to be feared and conquered.
