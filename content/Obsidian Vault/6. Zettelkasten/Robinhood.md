The philosophy that defines Robinhood is to "steal from the rich and give to the poor "; but this is deos not encompass the entirety of Robinhood's acts. 

Especially in a system that punishes the weak and rewards the corrupt. [[Power]], [[Neoliberalism]]. 

The lore behind this philosophy derives from how Richard the Lionhearted, a just respectable king that has left on a crusade, has been held captive and so his brother, John usurps the throne. Using this opportunity to construct a system that unjustly enriches himself and his associates. 

Yepi Von Platz examines the moral and ethical implications of the Robinhood philosophy 

It is easy to interpret Robinhood's society aligning with [[Distributive justice]] but it is more similar to [[Corrective justice]]

### Dealing with the effects of a broken system
Robinhood commits crime because it corrects the effect of a corrupt system; he is not for prevention but rather for the short term gratification of working within a corrupt system to make the individual effects of such a system less harmful. This inadvertently harms the aided individual in the long run because injustice comes off as less apparent. In fact it may give reason for people who hold power to worsen the disadvantaged's situations.
He is not interested in fixing the system itself, but to deal with the aftereffects. 
He effectively adds a band-aid to a severe problem. [[Working within a system]] 

### Two wrongs make a right 
The people who would that their position in society is earned as in a [[Meritocracy]], would argue that they do not deserve to be stolen from as much as the the poot, those who are supposedly undeserving, deserve to be compensated for their inherent mediocrity. This is a privilege take as it neglects the history and generational strife; suffering from an [[Authority bias]], those who would make such a claim, are already advantaged or have otherwise not seen what poverty or a disadvantaged life to truly be like. He does not necessarily distribute wealth based on merit but to those who have received unjust treatment. 

### Utilitarian influence
Actions are right or wrong based entirely on their end effects, not the actions themselves. [[Utilitarianism]] falls under [[Hedonism]] for the maximum amount of people, generally based on what happiness can be brought. However because there is no standard, only based on the effects of the action, this lends to subjective, corruptive [[Power]]. Cheating, stealing and lying can now circumstantially be permitted. Ends justify the means. This assumes that the socio-economic ethos is a [[Zero sum game]].
