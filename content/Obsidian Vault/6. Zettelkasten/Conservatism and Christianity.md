"The bible says xyz" 
- It also says to take out your eyes if you look ato someone else with lust
- You have to hate all of your family if you want to follow Jesus
- Not stoting up for yourselves treasures on earth and selling everything you have and giving it to the poor
- Not wearing mixed fabrics 
- No shellfish :(
- Stone disobediant children in the streets 
- Don't get divorced (minus this one - no fault marriage)
- Don't wear jewlwery 
- Women should be silent in church
----> But the part that says a man should not lie with a man as he does with a woman is taken literally...?
