Propaganda generally serves to create the illusion of “grassroots” activity: Making the leader look humble, strong, powerful etc. (Mussolini was a masculine leader, Hitler was a relatable uncle). This would encourage people to jump on the bandwagon of whatever narrative is popular, and destroy the character of enemy opponents. This makes the leader seem like an “average, relatable and trustworthy” citizen. The usage of mottos, catchy phrases, taglines etc. with (real or fake) testimonials to promote whatever message. The ultimate goal of this is to glorify the leader.

A charismatic leaders who is a talented and persuasive speaker can often create a “cult of personality”. In these situations, a leader can often be idealized, considered heroic, and worshiped by the population. In some cases, it is in a dictator’s best interest to add a certain mystique to their persona: Saddam Hussein requisitioned artwork of himself in various different forms of dress (military, traditional, religious etc.) in order to appeal to as many citizens as possible. Mussolini similarly, used propaganda to spread rumors of his death-defying service in WWI, causing some to believe that he was immortal.
