Given Maxwell's findings of the nature of light, electricity and magnetism he extended inertial laws to electrodynamics. He found that [boost symmetry of nature][Symmetry (physics)] should allow for electrodynamics to produce the same light with the differing frames of reference. 

For instance measuring the speed of light on a light clock on stationary vs. moving they should produce the same speed of light from their respective perspectives.
