Occam's razor is a guiding principle that states the explanation that makes the least amount of assumptions should be preferred when describing some new phenomena. Assuming that both explanations do an apt job in describing some phenomena, Occam's razor should be especially considered when introducing new information that does not completely fit with a model (adding ad hoc assumptions to new theories). A good example is preferring the heliocentric model of the solar system over the geocentric model = all planets orbiting the sun over epicycles around the Earth.
