If a machine possesses the capacities for replicating apparent human rationality, via communication in language, emotion, and will. Other ‘rational’ traits such as critical thinking, deliberation, self-awareness, predictive and explanatory capacities exhibited by a machine could constitute the machine acting as a person.

If a machine can functionally act as a human then it is a human.

This definition excludes those with severe mental disabilities, brain death, extreme youth, and unconsciousness.

If human beings are considered human because of their ‘rationality,’ then it follows that if a more rational being came into existence, they would be as if not more human than biological human beings.
