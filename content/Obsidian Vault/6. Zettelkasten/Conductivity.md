Materials which allow electrons to flow through them are conductors. Materials that donâ€™t are insulators. Semi conductors are materials that are good conductors under certain circumstances. Superconductors are materials that allow for conduction with very little resistance.
### The charge of the atom:

All matter is composed of atoms, and atoms are composed of three types of particles:

- Positively charged protons, p+
- Negatively charged electrons, e-
- Neutral neutrons, n0

The overall charge of an atom is neural (there are the same amount of electrons as protons)
As opposite charges attract, like charges repel. This is similar to a bar magnet.
It is only possible (viably at least) to remove/add electrons from its atom and create an ion
Law of conservation of charge: The total amount of charge present before two objects touch or otherwise interact, remains the same after said interaction.
