Joseph McCarthy was a US Senator (Wisconsin) who sought to attain power by any means necessary. McCarthy was looking to remove (and charge) spies, then communists, then people who were progressives, then people who even had a faint association with communism (Even in their distant past), then people who knew a communist, and even he simply did not like from government. This extended into daily life, where if someone wanted to get rid of someone else from their work or charged, all they had to do was accuse them of being a communist. No evidence was necessary, only the mere suspicion of sympathy was sufficient.
