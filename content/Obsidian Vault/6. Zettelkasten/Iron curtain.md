The Iron Curtain refers to the non-official border that divided states under Western influence, and states under Soviet influence. The animosity felt between the two sides was rooted in events till The Russian Revolution of 1917. Disagreements, annexation of European states, etc. upset western influences such as Warsaw Pact, and NATO. Physically, the Iron Curtain existed as a border of defense of the countries who were afraid of invasion, and sought a defense. An example of such a defense was the Berlin Wall, the “Checkpoint Charlie” of Central Europe and the Iron Curtain generally. The Iron Wall was held until the end of the Cold War in 1991, and symbolized the efforts made by the Soviet Union to isolate itself (and satellite states) from making contact with non-Soviet states (NATO states, and non-Soviet controlled states).
