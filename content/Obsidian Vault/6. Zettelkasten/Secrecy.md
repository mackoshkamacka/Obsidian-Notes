Secrecy is an art - in fact it is the ultimate aesthetic because it refuses to be intellectualized. Because of this, it is a tool that can esily be exploited by politicians. They can only be understood emotionally and subjectively. This is useful for exploiting the fear of the known unknown [[Fascism]].
