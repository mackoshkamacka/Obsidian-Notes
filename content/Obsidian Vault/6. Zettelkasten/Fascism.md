The term "fascism" comes from the Italian word -fascio and the Latin word fasces, which means sticks bundled around an axe. It was a response to liberal democracy and its economic and political ideas, such as capitalism and democracy. Fascism grew in popularity after WWI, especially in Italy and Germany. Many people felt that the values of liberalism had resulted in war, thus from a fascist perspective, democratic governments seemed weak, unstable, and unable to solve socio-economic and political issues.

Some of the key principles of fascism include: 
- The belief that society as a whole has a shared purpose.
- Want their particular nation-state to dominate other nations in the world.
- Very aware of ethnic and cultural group distinctions.
- Their goal of dominating other peoples can only be achieved through discipline, obedience, and the creation of an all-powerful state.
