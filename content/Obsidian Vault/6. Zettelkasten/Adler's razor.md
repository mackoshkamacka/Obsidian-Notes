Adler's razor (Newton's flaming laser sword - because it is "much sharper and more dangerous than [[Occam's Razor]] and it was inspired by Newtonian thought) = If something cannot be settled [empirically][Empiricism], then it is not worthy of debate. 

* In its weakest form it states that we should not dispute propositions unless they can be [rationally][Rationalism] deduced. = Something is not worth discussing if it can't be observed or known to be fact. [[Dogma]] 
* In its strongest form, it demands a list of observable consequences and formal demonstration that they are indeed consequences of the proposition claimed. = Very rigorous investigation
## Criticism
There are things that cannot be observed/experimented on that are worth discussion: e.g. art, emotions, literature, moral philosophy, etc. (which would include discussion of this razor...so???)
