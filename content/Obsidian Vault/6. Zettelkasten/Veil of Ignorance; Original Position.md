Tags: [[Thought Experiments]] [[Justice as Fairness]]

Rawls argues that a rational person would prefer justice as fairness to [[Utilitarianism]] behind the [[Veil of Ignorance; Original Position]]. People in the Original Position, OP, an individual has no conception of their current selves while being conscious: they exist in a kind of primordial form before they were assigned [[Race]], [[Gender]], [[Religion]], [[Social Class]] etc. by [[Fortune]]. This state is what Rawls refers to as being behind the veil of ignorance. This prompted parties in the OP to question in what world would they feel safe to enter if they did not know who they would be born as. And how we reform that society would be one where a person would [[Maximin]] their odds at having a happy life. 

*However there is an issue of qualia here. One might not know the extent to which someone faces hardship and would argue from their experience that it would be easier to be a disadvantaged group that receives more rewards per the Difference Principle. This can be seen when particularly white people weaponize their minority status e.g. "I'm a neurodivergent, queer, trans-fem disabled... so racism doesn't exist = [[Weaponized Minority Status]]"*

**Economic Thought Experiment**
Economic thought experiment: net value in a society = 100,000. 1 person has 90,000 and others distribute the remaining 10,000 vs. a society with a net value of 100,000 and 50% have 60,000 and the other 50% have 40,000. By distributing wealth, people would minmax their odds by being born in the second society.
