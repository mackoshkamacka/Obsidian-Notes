The Warsaw Pact was a military alliance formed in May 14th, 1955 as a response to the creation and exclusion of and from NATO. Soviet allies (Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania) formed this pact as a means of collective defense against NATO powers (especially the US). Dominated by the Soviet Union, the military was organized such that the large scale coordination was done on the behalf of (mainly) the Soviet Union. These included large scale troop deployment, simulated combat exercise, planning etc. This organization also sought to suppress revolts, and promote unity (especially against Western powers).
