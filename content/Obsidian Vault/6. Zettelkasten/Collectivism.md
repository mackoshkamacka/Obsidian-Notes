Collectivism is the belief that the goals of a society should be prioritized, where people function best as a group rather than independently.; in doing so providing a security for all people under this society. This ideology is broad and describes a wide range of [[Left-wing]] politics. This is largely considered to be the opposite of [[Individualism]]. 
### Principles of Collectivism 
P = Public Property (Areas of capital, land or real-estate not owned by individuals (privately) but by government)
(C) R = Collective Responsibility (Holding the entirety of a group responsible for the actions of a few/an individual)
(C) I = Collective Interests (Collective interest is the notion of common individual interests being addressed communally)
(C) N = Collective Norms (Adherence to some status quo, and restricting individuality such that the peace of collective is maintained)
C = Co-operation  (Working together to the same end)
E = Economic Equality (Minimizing wealth disparity, seizing the means of production and procuring common ecnomoic advantage of the people (Regardless of "effort," "innovation" etc.))
