### Overview 
Many economists believe that an infinitely growing economy is necessary as society becomes more modern. This has been accepted as truth for the past 200 years - moving from [[Agrarianism]] to [[Industrialism]], society shifted from a [[Zero sum game]] to a [[Positive sum game]] (people can have mutually beneficial transactions). These economists would argue that if society were to shift back to such a zero-sum game, we would unnecessarily fight over resources, labor, capital etc. instead of generating new value. 

The question of infinite growth is of maintaining a supposedly positive sum game with finite resources. 

In a general sense, 
Value = Labor + Capital + Resources 
As the efficiency of producing value increased, society could (supposedly*) produce more value with the same (or less if we are being generous) amount of fixed resources. 
How is efficiency improved? - Technology (However technology also has its own value function)
The problem with this is that the [[West]] produces waste at an unsustainable rate in the form of [[Global Warming]], Pollution etc. This destroys natural resources (or makes them less available). 

This leaves two stances: 
- Those who believe that ingenuity will rise with technology. E.g. Germany increased their GDP while reducing CO2 emissions. - The problem with this is that the rate of ingenuity may be too slow (or at least unpredictable) = may not be reasonable. 
- Those who believe that we should shift to a [[Degrowth]] or [[Postgrowth]] economy
