In a classical sense, this is an umbrella term for ideologies that advocate for work-owned means of production. As in actuality, socialism has several sub ideologies, e.g: [[Utopian socialism]], but is often referring to [[Communism]] which is a dub-ideology of [[Marxism]]. But in general, socialism supports worker coups; democratic self-management; and work place democracy; redistribution of wealth; taxation of the rich; nationalization of key parts of industry; and social ownership of capital.
