Extremist ideologies such as fascism, and communism, embrace totalitarianism (seeks to control public and private lives through sometimes violent means) to achieve their respective ends. These radical and reactionary ideologies create a hierarchy where one single political party/ small elite runs the state. They are often responding to what they see as dangerous and destabilizing changes * order in chaos through ‘democratic’ means. These ideologies also believe that society is in need of a complete transformation to be either: radically different or reactively regressive.

Some examples of ideologies that rejected liberalism include: [[Totalitarianism (Dictatorship)]], [[Authoritarianism]], [[Socialism]] (particularly how [[Development of Communism in the USSR]] occurred in Russia), [[Fascism]] (particularly how [[Development of Nazism]] occurred in Post WWI Germany), how there existed some [[Similarities Between Hitler and FDR]], and the ideological conflict, and carnage present in the [[Cold War]].
