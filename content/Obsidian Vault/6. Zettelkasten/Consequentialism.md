Consequentialism is an ethical theory that judges whether or not an action is right based on its consequences. The [[Maxim]] (intention behind an action) is irrelevant. 

For example: Telling a lie is wrong but if telling a lie to save another person's life saves them, it is the right thing to do. 

[[Utilitarianism]] is a consequentialist ethical theory. [[Kantianism]] is an ethical theory that fundamentally opposes this.
