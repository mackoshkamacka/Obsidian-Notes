The unionization of the workforce and establishment of local decentralized revolutionary worker organizations (syndicates) and advancement of worker demands through the usage of strikes and direct action are the best methods that a socialist society can be achieved. 

Once a [[Postcapitalist society]] has been achieved, a congress or commune of syndicates would be created to represent the unions and areas or the economy for a central government.
