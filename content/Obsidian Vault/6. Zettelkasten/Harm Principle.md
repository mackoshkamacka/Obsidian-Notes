Harm principle = An individual should be free as long as their actions do not infringe on the rights, interests and wellbeing of others. 
Harm = An action that would injure the rights of someone else or set back important interests that benefit others. 
Damage = physical harm that impairs the value, usefulness or normal function of something. 
Risk = A situation involving exposure to danger. 
* This is an outdated model as sociological, mental and other forms of non-physical harm exist. 
Mill argues that society should make an effort to minimize the amount of harm, while not infringing on the individual's right to afflict isolated self harm. E.g. Distribution of poisons should be banned for commercial use. Alcohol should be regulated, such that one can drink themselves to death - they can only harm another through indirect involvement with intoxication. They are the most at risk.
