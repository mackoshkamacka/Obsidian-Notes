### Laws of Addition and Multiplication 
- Closure: $a+b$ and $a \cdot b$ are integers, whenever $a$ and $b$ are integers. 
- Commutative laws: $a+b=b+a$ and $a\cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all integers $a$ and $b$. 
- Associative laws: $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ and $(a\cdot b) \cdot = a \cdot (b\cdot c)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$. 
- Distributive law: $(a+b)\cdot c = ac + bc$ and $(a\cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b\cdot c)$ for all integers $a, b$ and $c$.
- Identity elements: $a+0= a$ and $a\cdot 1=a$ for all integers of $a$. 
- Additive inverse: For every integer $a$ there is an integer solution $x$ to the equation $a+x=0$; this integer $x$ is called the additive inverse of $a$ and is denoted by $-a$. By $b-a$ we mean $b-(-a).$ 
- Cancellation law: If $a, b$ and $c$ are integers with $a\cdot c = b \cdot c$ with $c \ne 0$, then $a=b$. 
### Further Laws and Properties 
By ordering the positive integers' in the order: $1,2,3...$ the following definition stands:
	If $a$ and $b$ are integers, then $a<b$ if $b-a$ is a positive integer. ($a<b = b>a$). 

From this, the following laws can be found: 
* Closure for the Positive Integers: $a+b$ and $a\cdot b$ are positive integers whenever $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. 
*  Trichotomy law: For every integer $a$, either $a>0$, $a=0$, or $a<0$. 

Basic properties of ordering numbers can be proved using these axioms. 
* The Well-Ordering Property: Every nonempty set of positive integers least. (The set of positive integers is Well-Ordered because there is the lowest element, while the entire integer doesn't as there is no lower bound). 

With the following definition: $[x]$ = largest integer less than or equal to $x$ where $x \in \mathbb{R}$, then, $[x] \leq x < [x] +1$.  This is also known as the [[Floor and ceiling functions]]. 

An example of proofs that use these principles is the [[Proof that âˆš2 is irrational]].
