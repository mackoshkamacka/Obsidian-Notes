The USA Patriot Act: (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism, Act) of 2001 had the aim of broadening the security powers of law-enforcement agencies to identify and stop terrorists. The US government justified a need for increased security to deter and punish terrorist attacks in the US and around the world. This was heavily challenged by groups who this law was a threat to. In reality, this Patriot Act was haphazardly targeted towards Muslim and Arab peoples. It also enabled federal agencies to spy and probe people who "demonstrated a threat of being a terrorist"
