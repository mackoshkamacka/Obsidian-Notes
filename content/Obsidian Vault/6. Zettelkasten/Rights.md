People who believe that there are essential human rights, for example, argue that we’re simply entitled to have our most basic needs fulfilled - things like having enough to eat, and being able to go to the doctor when we’re sick. However, not everyone believes that it is the government’s job to provide us with those things, if we’re not able to get them ourselves.

Some argue that because rights are negative: cannot stop nor prevent an individual from doing something. Contrasting this, positive rights proclaim that people are entitled to something if they cannot attain it themself. If you cannot afford a doctor or a lawyer, you are entitled to one. A right implies an obligation.
