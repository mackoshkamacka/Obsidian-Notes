## Fundamental and Derived Units
Fundamental SI units

|Quantity|SI unit|Symbol|
|---|---|---|
|Mass|Kilogram|kg|
|Distance|Meter|m|
|Time|Second|s|
|Electric current|Ampere|A|
|Amount of substance|Mole|mol|
|Temperature|Kelvin|K|
Derived units are combinations of fundamental units. Some examples are:
- m/s (Unit for velocity)
- N (kg*m/s^ (Unit for force)
- J (kg*m^2/s^2) (Unit for energy)

## Scientific Notation and Metric Multipliers 
In scientific notation, values are written in the form $a10^n$, where $a$ is a number between 1 and 10 and $n$ is any integer. Some examples are:
- The speed of light is $300000000 m/s$. In scientific notation, this is expressed as $3\times10^8$
- A centimeter (cm) is 1/100 of a meter (m). In scientific notation, one cm is expressed as $1\times10^-2 m$. 

|Prefix|Abbreviation|Value|
|---|---|---|
|peta|P|10^15|
|tera|T|10^12|
|giga|G|10^9|
|mega|M|10^6|
|kilo|k|10^3|
|hecto|h|10^2|
|deca|da|10^1|
|deci|d|10^-1|
|centi|c|10^-2|
|milli|m|10^-3|
|micro|μ|10^-6|
|nano|n|10^-9|
|pico|p|10^-12|
|femto|f|10^-15|
## Significant Figures 
 For a certain value, all figures are significant, except:

1. Leading zeros
2. Trailing zeros if this value does not have a decimal point, for example:

- 12300 has 3 significant figures. The two trailing zeros are not significant.
- 012300 has 5 significant figures. The two leading zeros are not significant. The two trailing zeros are significant.

When multiplying or dividing numbers, the number of significant figures of the result value should not exceed the least precise value of the calculation.

The number of significant figures in any answer should be consistent with the number of significant figures of the given data in the question.
## Orders of Magnitude
Orders of magnitude are given in powers of 10, likewise those given in the scientific notation section previously.

Orders of magnitude are used to compare the size of physical data.

|Distance|Magnitude (m)|Order of magnitude|
|---|---|---|
|Diameter of the observable universe|10^26|26|
|Diameter of the Milky Way galaxy|10^21|21|
|Diameter of the Solar System|10^13|13|
|Distance to the Sun|10^11|11|
|Radius of the Earth|10^7|7|
|Diameter of a hydrogen atom|10^-10|10|
|Diameter of a nucleus|10^-15|15|
|Diameter of a proton|10^-15|15|
|Mass|Magnitude (kg)|Order of magnitude|
|The universe|10^53|53|
|The Milky Way galaxy|10^41|41|
|The Sun|10^30|30|
|The Earth|10^24|24|
|A hydrogen atom|10^-27|-27|
|An electron|10^-30|-30|

|Time|Magnitude (s)|Order of magnitude|
|---|---|---|
|Age of the universe|10^17|17|
|One year|10^7|7|
|One day|10^5|5|
|An hour|10^3|3|
|Period of heartheart|10^0|0|
## Random and Systematic Errors

## Absolute, Fractional and Percentage Uncertainties
Physical measurements are sometimes expressed in the form x±Δx. For example, 10±1 would mean a range from 9 to 11 for the measurement.

|Absolute uncertainty|Δx|
|---|---|
|Fractional uncertainty|Δx /x|
|Percentage uncertainty|Δx/x*100%|

Calculating with uncertainties

|Addition/Subtraction|y=a±b|Δy=Δa+Δb (sum of absolute uncertainties)|
|---|---|---|
|Multiplication/Division|y=a*b or y=a/b|Δy/y=Δa/a+Δb/b (sum of fractional uncertainties)|
|Power|y=a^n|Δy/y=|
## Error Bars 
Error bars are bars on graphs which indicate uncertainties. They can be horizontal or vertical, with the total length of two absolute uncertainties.

* NOTE: a strong linear correlation with a slope or r = 0 is still considered to have no correlation.
