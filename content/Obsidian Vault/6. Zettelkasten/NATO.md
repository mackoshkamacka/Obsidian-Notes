Formed in response to the spread of communism, NATO was formed with the intention of posing a larger threat to keep the USSR and her allies in check. 

NATO is an intergovernmental military alliance, signed April 4, 1949 and was a superset of the Treaty of Brussels states (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, The UK) and of the US, Canada, Portugal, Italy Denmark, and Iceland. Their purpose lay in defending against the perceived threat of communist expansionism/growth of the supposed Soviet Empire after WWII. Article 5: In particular states that an armed attack against any one state, is an attack on all states. This mutual security was enforced with military integration with the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) that would serve the same function as The Warsaw Pact organizing military exercises across nations. They also would play a large role in nuclear deterrence as the arms race would start and escalate; in the Berlin Blockade, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan.
