The West was afraid that this would extend past Germany as the Soviet Army took everything that remained in Germany. This was expected as Soviet troops forcibly made Baltic States (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria) part of the USSR/communist. For these states,, WWII did not end, their occupation merely changed from one dictator to another. This differed from the West who sought to establish a new currency, repair their economy etc. (Ultimately to create German dependence on the West for their support). In early 1946, George Kennan, the Charg√© D'affaires in the American embassy in Moscow (2nd hand man) begins to write the "long telegram" = Stalin wants more of Europe, power etc. and the West must stop the spread of communism. Kennan proposed that the only way to combat this threat was to confront it with the aggressive spread of "democratic values."
