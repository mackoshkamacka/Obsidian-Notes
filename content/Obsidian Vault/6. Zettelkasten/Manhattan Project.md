The Manhattan Project was a program of research continued from WWII into the Cold War to develop the first nuclear weapons. It was funded by $25.8 billion USD (2012), worked by 130,000 people. Some notable people: Julius Robert Oppenheimer (head physicist), Joseph Rotblat (only scientist to leave the Manhattan Project), and Leslie Richard (Dick) Groves Jr., Brigadier General of the US Army (took charge over the Manhattan Project in 1942, engineer for the military; ensured that the Pentagon was constructed = familiar with big projects). It was based in Los Alamos, New Mexico, however Groves had access to several facilities across the US as he formally championed the priority off this project as a war effort. After this project grew, more than 600,000 people were employed with Oppenheimer as the scientific director.
