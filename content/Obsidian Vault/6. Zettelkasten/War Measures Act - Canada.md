This Act was passed in 1914 (during WWI) and was invoked only 3 times (During WWI, WWII, October Crisis, 1970). This gave the federal cabinet emergency powers if there were some large-scale threat to the nation (war, invasion, or insurrection, real or apprehended, existed). The justification for this was: it was necessary for the overall good of society; rectifying a dire situation; protecting, retaining, and securing other principles of liberalism.

### WWI: Ukrainian Internment 
Under the War Measures Act, immigrants from "enemy" countries were considered **enemy aliens**. This targeted Ukrainian-Canadians. This was done by: Registering (And carrying) government issued IDs at all times; speaking exclusively English and French; must stay in the country; could not possess firearms; and banned them from joining any "dangerous" group of the government. Additionally, several thousands of enemy aliens are deported or sent to **internment camps**; their property was consequently seized, and kept (these camps were closed in 1920 (two years after WWI ended)). To this day, no apology or compensation was offered. 
### WWII: Japanese Internment
At the end of the war, the government decided to remove all Japanese people from B.C. (4,000 Japanese people moved East, only able to return after 1949). In 1988, PM Brian Mulroney publicly acknowledged the unjust actions and awards $21,000 for each individual directly wronged. In 2012, an additional compensation package was offered by the Harper government. 

### October Crisis, 1970 
The 1960s were a period of change, true also in Quebec.: The Quiet Revolution. Rapid secularization of society, the province took control of education and healthcare from the Catholic Church. This also led to a surge in Québécois nationalism, aimed at enhancing opportunities for Francophones in Quebec. The Front de Liberation du Quebec (FLQ) felt that the pace of change was too slow and felt that terrorism was necessary to achieve their goals: 
- In the 1960s a series of bombings and armed robberies (largest, was the Montreal Stock Exchange, 27 injured). 
- During October 1970: 
	- The FLQ abducted James Cross, British trade commissioner. 
	- Kidnapped Pierre Laporte, a Quebec cabinet minister. 
	- Army sent to protect politicians. 
	- War Measures Act was invoked. 
	- About 500 arrested without warrants, could be held for up to 90 days. 
		- i.e. teachers, artists, journalists, unionists, etc. who supported Quebec nationalism. 
		- Criticisms
			- Powers of government were too broad and too aggressive for 2 kidnappings and 1 murder. 
			- The government acted on limited information 
			- Treated all separatists as terrorists. 

This act turned into the [[Emergencies Act - Canada]]
