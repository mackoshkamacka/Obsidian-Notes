In February 1945, The Big 3 (France, Britain, and the US) met to plan wartime actions and post-war Europe. The outcomes of this conference was the division of Germany into 4 zones occupied by each member of the Big 3 and the USSR, with the division of the world into ideological camps; the balance of power was destroyed; parties negotiated not for what was collectively best, but best for their nation. The West wanted to prevent the spread of communism, where the East wanted to spread it. This resulted in major conflicting interests.

The small portion of land occupied by all three in the Soviet region, Berlin was also split. And in 1949, the French, British and American zones of occupation were combined to create a new state: The German Federal Republic (West Germany).
