## Overview
Plato's main motivation in writing [[The Republic, Plato]] was to construct a theory for the ideal, perfect governing system. This matched his [[Theory of Forms]] where reality existed as an imperfect version of these forms. If implemented society would become a [[Utopia]] where society would be of perfect peace and prosperity. This republic would be governed by the [[Enlightened]] who possessed knowledge of perfect forms. Laws would be based on the perfect form of justice, which would be opposed to the Athenian Democratic System of his day (which was governed by the unenlightened mob). 

Aristocracy (Plato) - Land ownership, Virtue, Warriors 
Oligarchy - Wealth, Expertise: Education and Experience
Timocracy (Plato) - Land ownership and wealth. Leaders become less virtuous, and may abuse their power. May act for military service to protect their land
Democracy - Majority rules does not necessarily mean its the best course of action - Ship of Fools
Tyranny - Use of force to justify the concentration of power, often begins with popular support 
### [[Aristocracy]]
Plato describes aristocracy as ‘just.’ As leaders are educated and wise in important matters. That being defending their land, and maintaining their socio-economic position against the people and invasive forces. Such leaders are trained to govern and rule. The working or ‘producing’ class lacked these qualities and would subsequently refrained from acquiring positions of power. Aristocracy derives from the rule of the best. Wherein the ‘best’ are those who are noble and held power in such systems. This would typically be inherited, and thus would be contrasted favorably with monarchy. To have such an aristocracy, there would need to exist some [[Classical Virtue]] among the ruling class, and some disinterested [[Philosopher King]] to ensure that there is no corruption or  abuses of [[Power]]. 

Plato's ideal form of government: 
- Children would be raised be raised by he state, not by family. 
- People would be divided into specific divisions of labor in accordance to their talents (virtues). - Into Warriors, Producing Class, [[Philosopher King]]s, etc. - He argues that this is the best organization of society as everyone knows their place. 
- Resources would be distributed equitably among citizens. 
### [[Oligarchy]]; [[Plutocracy]]; [[Timocracy]]
Oligarchy on the other hand differs from aristocracy as it is a form of government, wherein a few people rule. Inheritance, unlike aristocracy, is not a requirement. Oligarchy is associated with tyranny and oppression. 

A subset of this form of governance is plutocracy. Wherein the richest, wealthiest and most affluent portion of the population govern. (Ploutos meaning wealth in Greek). 

Timocracy is the first degradation of aristocracy. It is a result of the entitlement and loss of virtue that a new generation of leaders have. When the focus shifts to the immediate value to aristocracy than what is best for the nation (note that ‘nation’ could mean the government or the working class).

Leaders are instead focused on material gain, and have inherited their position from past, wiser leaders. Additionally, current leaders are high in passion and spirit but deficient in complexity - thus tending towards having grand goals with ineffective solutions, and a tendency towards violence and war. Said lack of experience results in hasty, haphazard and miscalculated action. Following the rational behind [[Qualia]], (a common notion in Ancient Greek philosophy) if something lacks at least one of its characteristic traits it ceases to be the same thing. Thus Plato argues that this form of government is separate to that of aristocracy.

### [[Democracy]]
Plato argued that most people are unenlightened, and easily manipulated by clever, self interested people like the Sophists. Additionally because the people have diverse interests, they will be constantly divided over issues; leaving the state in a constant state of conflict. 

Plato believes that a large population of commoners overthrows a government and subsequently makes suboptimal choices. Wherein commoners get to vote on decisions that are best for them and not necessarily for the nation. There will be a tendency to elect the most appealing demagogue. Thus framing democracy as a popularity contest wherein inefficient decision is made. Plato likens this this to anarchy. The allegory of the ship of fools is used to demonstrate this. [[Ship of Fools]]; A kind of mob rule. 

The collective decision making process allows for equality at an important point of decision making. Although it is true that having every citizen’s opinion represented to be inefficient, the best means of representing the opinions of the greatest denominator of people would be via a direct democracy. Where an elected official represents the opinions of the people such that they can be actualized. [[Direct Democracy]] [[Representative Democracy]] 
### [[Tyranny]]

Plato posits that the natural progression of a democracy whether direct or representative results in tyranny. Either because the people seek tyrannical order from a direct democracy (supposedly akin to anarchy) or the charismatic demagogue is stubborn in their decisions and will adamantly appeal to their personal interests, taking advantage of the fear of chaos.

Power, once attained is meant to be maintained via terror, threat of force and abuse of power.

Why would aristocrats care for others - observations made throughout history. 
You do not know the difference between timocracy and aristocracy until after the fact
This makes the illegitimacy of timocracy masquerading as aristocracy only apparent after the fact - Which is useless.
