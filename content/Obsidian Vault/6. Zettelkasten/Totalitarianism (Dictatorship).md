### Overview 
Totalitarianism is a dominant ideology (the moral code depends on the state) that legitimizes violence as a mean to establish their ideology (radical and reactionary). An example of a radical totalitarian regime is the Soviet Union: far left side of the economic spectrum (equality, classless society), complete rejection of traditions of past. An example of a reactionary totalitarian state is the Nazi state (they used a planned economy in pseudo capitalism - businesses can only manufacture state approved goods, while receiving some of the profits). They often are far right, idealize the past and an acceptance of inequality (some are naturally better than others).

- Single ruling party (one ruler, or small group or elite).
- Use terror (secret police, military).
- Monopoly on information (education system, media).
- Planned economy (command on pseudo-capitalist, state monitored).

*Mussolini was the first explicitly fascist leader. “Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.”

### Totalitarianism vs. [[Authoritarianism]]
A totalitarian (dictatorship) is ruled by a **single leader** who holds **unlimited power** and whishes to **abolish political pluralism**. These leaders are often **charismatic**, as they gain legitimacy through **democracy** and thus tend to have better control over the population's thoughts and beliefs. Additionally there tends to be less corruption. 

An authoritarian government tends to be led by someone of **low charisma** who has no legitimacy from the population. Because there is less control, there is a larger sphere for personal life, and limited pluralism. Additionally, there is no official ideology for authoritarianism.

#### Modern Example: [[North Korea]] 

#### Methods used:
[[Censorship]], [[Indoctrination]], [[Directing Popular Discontent (Scapegoating)]], [[Controlled Participation]], [[Propaganda & Cult of Personality]], [[Fear and Terror]]
