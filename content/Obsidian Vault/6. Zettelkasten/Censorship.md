Censorship is the control of information or ideas that are considered offensive/threatening to a regime. This can be censorship of books, play, films, television, radio, news reports, music arts etc. This includes removing critical texts but also creating news for the explicit purpose of promoting the regime. Censorship is often justified as being a protector of the church, family or state. (E.g. Book burning at the Universities of Berlin and Nuremberg in 1933).

In North Korea, Kimâ€™s regime owns all of the domestic news outlets. Journalists belong to the regime, radio and television sets were issued by government, internet access was limited to an intranet (filtered by government), school curriculum, plays, movies, and operas centers on improving the reputation of the Kim family.
