Suppose that $\sqrt 2$ were rational. 
Then there would exist some integers $a$ and $b$ such that $\frac a b = \sqrt 2$.  
Consequently, the set $S = \{  k \sqrt 2 |k$ and $k \sqrt 2$ are positive integers$\}$ is a nonempty set of positive integers (as $a=b\sqrt2$ is a member of $S$). 
Therefore by the well-ordering property, $S$ has a smallest element, say $s = t\sqrt 2$. 
$s \sqrt 2 -s = s\sqrt 2-t \sqrt 2$. 
Because $s \sqrt 2 = 2t$ and $s$ are both integers, $s \sqrt 2 -s = (s-t)\sqrt 2$ must also be an integer. 
Furthermore, it is positive as $s\sqrt2 -s = s (\sqrt 2 -1)$ and $\sqrt 2 > 1$. 
It is less than $s$ as $s =t\sqrt 2, s\sqrt 2 = 2t$ and $\sqrt 2 < 2$. 
This contradicts the choice of $s$ as the smallest positive integer in $S$. 
It follows that the converse, $\sqrt 2$ is irrational.

Let's suppose $\sqrt 2$ is a rational number. Then we can write it $\sqrt 2$ = $\frac a b$ where $a, b$ are positive integers and, $b \neq 0$.
We additionally assume that  $\frac a b$ is simplified to the lowest terms, since that can obviously be done with any fraction. Notice that in order for $\frac a b$ to be in the simplest terms, both of $a$ and $b$ cannot be even. One or both must be odd. Otherwise, we could simplify $\frac a b$ further.
From the equality $\sqrt 2$ = $\frac a b$ it follows that $2 =\frac {a^2} {b^2}$.  So the square of $a$ is an even number since it is two times something.
From this, we know that $a$ itself is also an even number. Why? Because it can't be odd; if $a$ itself was odd, then $a · a$ would be odd too. Odd number times odd number is always odd. 
If $a$ itself is an even number, then $a$ is 2 times some other whole number.  ($a = 2k$, where k is this other number. Where $k$ is just some number) 

If we substitute $a = 2k$ into the original equation, $2 =\frac {a^2} {b^2}$ we get:
$2 = \frac {(2k)^2} {b^2}$
$2 = \frac {4k^2} {b^2}$
$2b^2 = 4k^2$
$b^2 = 2k^2$

This would imply that $b^2$ is even. As it is impossible to make an even square with odd numbers, $b$ must be even as well. 
This contradicts, as assuming that $\frac a b$ is in its lowest terms would imply that 2 is not a factor. 
It follows that the converse, $\sqrt 2$ is irrational
