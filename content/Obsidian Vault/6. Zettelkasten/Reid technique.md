### Application
This method of interrogation was developed in the US by John E. Reid in the 1950s. By putting the interviewee in a high pressure environment, followed by sympathy and understanding, they are likely to elicit a confession.

Proponents would argue that it is effective at drawing out information from unwilling suspects

Critics point out the extreme amount of false confessions that are a direct result of this technique. For mentally impaired individuals, people who have communication difficulties (speaking another native language, illiterate, stress etc.) this is particularly effective. 
In addition, strong-willed interviewees are less likely to open up rather than having them talk and contradict themself (If they stay silent, they have more defenses than if they were to try to act innocent, lie and eventually produce logical inconsistencies with their testimonies.)
Police often apply this technique on subjects of unclear guilt when simply gathering information. In what is meant to be a non-stressful interrogation process, both guilty and innocent interviewees are likely to confess. 
### Process 
1. Positive confrontation. Advise the suspect that the evidence has led the police to the individual as a suspect. Offer the person an early opportunity to explain why the offense took place.
2. Try to shift the blame away from the suspect to some other person or set of circumstances that prompted the suspect to commit the crime. That is, develop themes containing reasons that will psychologically justify or excuse the crime. Themes may be developed or changed to find one to which the accused is most responsive.
3. Try to minimize the frequency of suspect denials.
4. At this point, the accused will often give a reason why he or she did not or could not commit the crime. Try to use this to move towards the acknowledgement of what they did.
5. Reinforce sincerity to ensure that the suspect is receptive.
6. The suspect will become quieter and listen. Move the theme of the discussion toward offering alternatives. If the suspect cries at this point, infer guilt.
7. Pose the "alternative question", giving two choices for what happened; one more socially acceptable than the other. The suspect is expected to choose the easier option but whichever alternative the suspect chooses, guilt is admitted. There is always a third option which is to maintain that they did not commit the crime.
8. Lead the suspect to repeat the admission of guilt in front of witnesses and develop corroborating information to establish the validity of the confession.
9. Document the suspect's admission or confession and have him or her prepare a recorded statement (audio, video or written).
