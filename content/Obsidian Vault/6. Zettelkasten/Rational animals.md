If rationality is defined to be the capacity to communicate language, have sophisticated, complex social arrangements, personal desires, deliberation, strong emotion and some capacity for problem solving, then animals are also rational. Modern research suggests this. Dolphins, parrots, corvids, octopuses, elephants and several other animals exhibit rationality to a varying extent. If rationality is viewed as a spectrum instead of the classical binaries of [[Kant]], [[Descartes]], and Greek philosophers, then all animals are rational - but to a certain extent. Thereby making the qualifier of ‘animal’ unnecessary, as it does not logically exclude any other organism. This would imply the [[Personhood of AI]] and machines. As they are not only more rational than human beings, by Hume’s framework and without, as they do not exhibit the same irrational behavior that ironically characterizes human beings.
