Albert Tucker’s thought experiment, the Prisoner’s dilemma formulated by game theorists, Merrill Flood, and Melvin Dresher, A and B are put in jail for a shared crime. The prosecution does not have enough evidence to harshly convict A or B. If A confesses and implicates B, A gets a reduced sentence and while B gets a longer sentence. vice verse.
