"I knew as well as I knew anything, that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away another man's freedom is a prisoner of hatred, he is locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrowmindedness ... The oppressed and the oppressor alike are robbed of their Humanity" - Nelson Mandela 

Although this minimizes the suffrage of the oppressed; by enacting retributive justice upon another, one is participating in a cycle of hatred/violence which perpetuates cyclical hatred. This at first leaves heinous acts unchecked, but as prejudices become less normalized, they will cease the cycle. 

[[Retributive justice]]  only makes sense for individuals - not cultures of people (Say cultures built on taking revenge on others because oppression is institutionalized.) 

The focus is on making amends rather than on making the wrongdoer suffer. This is the principle behind community service. (polar opposite of retributive approach)
