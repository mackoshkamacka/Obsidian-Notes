[[Biblical allusions]]

Christian doctrine that believes that human beings are born sinful/tainted. This originates from Genesis 3 - the expulsion of Adam and Eve. This was Eve disobeying God by eating the forbidden fruit (of knowledge or good and evil.) This transmitted sin is hereditary to their descendants. This is the basis on which the bible was built. 

Original sin explains things such as genocide, war, cruelty, exploitation and abuse.
