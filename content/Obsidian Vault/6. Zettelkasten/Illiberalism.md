The adherence to the principles of liberalism is often tested in democracies during times of crisis. This is especially true during times of war, emergency, and natural crisis, liberal democracies have restricted movement, controlled access to information and limited peoples' rights and freedoms. 

During times of war, governments often introduce the illiberal practices of [[censorship]] for concerns to safety and security, as well as other methods. Such examples can be found in the [[War Measures Act - Canada]], [[Patriot Act - US]], [[Anti-Terrorism Act C51- Canada]]. This is also seen with [[No-fly lists]], aggressive airport screenings, and blatant restriction of religious freedoms (e.g. France banning hijabs in schools, then turbans & yarmulkes, and then large Christian crosses). The justification for this can often be seen in how [[Extremism creates fear]]. ... Illiberalism can also be found throughout [[African History]]
