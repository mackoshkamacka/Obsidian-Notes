Indoctrination is the process of teaching a person/group to accept a set of beliefs uncritically. This technique is used to instill a particular set of values into a demographic. This is ideally done in youth, however, adults are also vulnerable.

In Italy, Mussolini replaced all historical materials in schools with versions that glorified fascism, then banned all the books that contradicted that view. His control of the education system was such that he was once quoted as saying, “_At every hour of every day, I can tell you on which page of each book each school child is reading in Italy._” Teachers and professors were made to swear an oath of allegiance to Mussolini. “_I believe in Rome, the eternal, the mother of my country. I believe in the genius of Mussolini and in the resurrection of the empire.”_
