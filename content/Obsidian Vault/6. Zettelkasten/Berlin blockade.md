To control Berlin, the Soviets cut access from the Western Germany to West Berlin as Berlin was inside of East Germany. This starved Western Germans for a significant period of time. However, the West responded with the air bridge: the largest air transportation effort in history (food, necessities, coal etc. were transported by air). 

Soviets sought the weaker Germany buffer zone. Allies wanted a strong German economy - West Berlin revitalized under the [[Marshall Plan]] and a new currency backed by the American Economy. Preferred in Berlin - people avoided using the Soviet backed currency. Stalin responds with the ground blockage. 11 months, 277,804 flights, 1949 Stalin lifted the blockade.
