AKA Giume's razor = modified Occam's razor

> It’s a play of words on Occam’s Razor, which is fitting since Grice was a semanticist. It means don’t take things too literally; it is possible to infer meaning from something not said. When you ask is someone is going to the birthday party and they say “let me go to the bathroom” you can infer they are going, immediately after they go to the bathroom. That statement, said in that context, is misleading if it means anything else. It’s also a social sin if you use it any way other than to mean you are going just after you go to the bathroom.

Basically prioritizing simplicity (parsimony) in interpreting meaning by using context.
