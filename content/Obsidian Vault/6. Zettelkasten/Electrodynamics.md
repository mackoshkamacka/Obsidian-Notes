## Wave Phenomena !!
For more information on waves, see Simple Harmonic Motion in [[Kinematics]]. 
### Interaction with Mediums
#### Reflection
![[ewgrgrf.gif]]

Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection. 
Reflection of waves from a fixed end is inverted.
![[dssfdsfds.gif]]
Reflection of waves from a free end is not inverted.
![[4rgfg.gif]]

#### Refraction and Snell's Law
Refraction is the change in direction of a wave when it transmits from one medium to another.
![[ergrter.png]]
The angle of incidence and the angle of refraction can be determined by Snell’s law given by the following formula (Snell's Law)
$$\frac {n_1}{n_2} = \frac {sin\theta _2} {sin \theta 1} = \frac {\lambda _1}{\lambda _2} = \frac {v_1} {v_2} $$
Where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the speed of the waves in their respective mediums and $λ_1$ and $λ_2$ are the wavelength of the waves of their respective mediums. 

![[ewtr4tr.gif]]
![[dffgfdd.gif]]

The refractive index and the critical angle are related by the following equation: 
$$sin \theta _c = \frac 1 {n_1}$$
Total internal reflection only occurs when the light ray propagates from a optically denser medium to an optically less dense medium.
### Standing Waves !!
Nodes and Antinodes: 
Positions along the wave which are fixed are called nodes (minimum) and those with the largest displacement are called antinodes (maximum).
For standing waves, the distance between adjacent nodes = the distance between adjacent antinodes = λ/2.

![[56ttrtr.gif]]


Standing waves (stationary) waves result from the superposition of two opposite waves which are otherwise identical.
Energy is not transferred by standing waves.
![[3.png]]
#### Pipes 
Air particles can oscillate and create standing waves in pipes with open or closed ends.
Antinodes are positioned at open ends and nodes are positioned at closed ends.
Standing waves on a string is equivalent to that in a pipe which is closed on both ends (nodes-node).
The following table summarizes the behavior of standing waves in pipes and strings:

![[Pasted image 20240702172614.png]]






### Single Slit Diffraction
After passing through a narrow aperture (slit/gap/opening), a wave propagating in a specific direction tends to disperse. An example of this is when a wave passes through a narrow slit: 

![[Pasted image 20240629235338.jpg]]
![[Pasted image 20240629235309.png]]

For this to be observed, the ratio of wavelength to slit ratio must be in a specific range: Diffraction of waves can only occur is the gap is narrow enough, and light (390-770nm) can only be diffracted with a narrow enough slit:

![[rtu6jyrtrt6w.png]]

![[slide23.png]]

According to Huygens' principle, every part of the wave front in the slit emits wavelets (rays that start out in phase and head in all directions, where each is perpendicular to the wave front of the wavelet.) In essence, each wave can be thought of as a line, made up of points. Each point emits a spherical 'mini-wave' and when it goes through a slit, it rounds out because there are no more spheres to make it straight. 

![[wavelets-Huygens-fronts-wave-front-plane-waves.webp]]
![[waves-wave-principle-plane-point-Huygens-BB.webp]]
### Young's Double Slit Experiment
Given the dispersion seen in single slit dispersion, when two slits are next to each other, the wave's interfere with each other: There are two extreme kinds of interference, destructive and constructive: 

Constructive interference occurs when two crests or two troughs are at the same point: amplifying the two (or when two points of a wave of equal magnitude and amplitude superimpose on each other). e.g. wave A has a point of the wave with a height of 1, and wave B has a height of 1 at the same point. The resulting interference is constructive as the resulting amplitude is 2. 
Destructive interference occurs when a crest and a trough 'cancel' each other by having the same magnitude with 'opposite' amplitude: e.g. wave A has a point of the wave with a height of 1, and wave B has a height of -1 at the same point. When they interfere, they have a resulting height of 0 as they destructively interfere. 

![[Pasted image 20240630001740.jpg]]

The resulting pattern that appears on a screen looks as follows: 
![[Pasted image 20240630001900.jpg]]
![[light-fringes-double-slit-experiment-path-difference-slits.webp]]
![[Pasted image 20240630002301.png]]

### Modulation of Two-Slit Interference Pattern by One-Slit Diffraction Effect

The previous section shows an ideal double-slit which ignores the single-slit characteristics of each of the two single-slits. A true double-slit would exhibit closely spaced dark and light areas (fringes) superimposed over the single-slit pattern. The single-slit profile is said to modulate the double-slit pattern.

![[iuhihhoopj.gif]]
### Multiple Slit Diffraction 
With each new slit introduced, the 'subpeaks' within a peak become increasingly extreme relative to their minimum intensities. 

![[Pasted image 20240630003750.jpg]]
![[Pasted image 20240630003603.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240630003548.jpg]]

### Diffraction Grating
A diffraction grating is the tool of choice for separating the colors in incident light. They separate light because they have a microscopic groove structure that splits incident light into multiple beam paths though diffraction, which in turn causes the light to be refracted at different angles (as each has a wavelength has a different refraction index). 

![[all-about-diffraction-gratings-fig1.webp]]

Note that violet disperses the least as per Snell's law
![[Pasted image 20240630005222.jpg]]

![[main-qimg-ee8e81a1cf5c6a008e614243534198b5.webp]]

### Thin Film Interference 
Interference between light waves is the reason that thin films, such as soap bubbles, show colorful patterns. The interference of light waves reflects off the top surface of a film, with the waves reflecting from the bottom of the surface.

![[image 2.gif]]

Reflected waves undergo a 180 degree phase shift when $n_2 >n_1$ and no phase shift when reflecting from a medium of lower index of refraction ($n_2<n_1$). 

![[image 1.gif]]


### The Size of a Diffracting Aperture 
When light from a point source passes through a small circular aperture, it does not produce a bright dot as an image, but rather as a diffused circular disc.
![[image 1.png]]
The greater the diameter of the diffracting aperture (such as the diameter of the pupil in the human eye or the diameter of the lens in a telescope), the better resolved (clearer) the image is.
### The Resolution of Simple Monochromatic Two-Source Systems 
Consider the diffraction pattern of two light beams diffracted by a single slit. These patterns can be categorized as resolved, just resolved, or not resolved depending on the separation between the images.

![[Pasted image 20240630010541.png]]
![[kjnoihjopij.jpg]]

The Rayleigh criterion is when two points are just resolved. This is when the central maximum of one image coincides with the first minimum of the other.

The minimum angular separation θ (in radians) for two points to be just resolved is given by$$\theta = \frac {1.22 \theta} a $$ Where $a$ is the diameter of the circular aperture, and λ is the wavelength and a is the diameter of the circular aperture lens receiving the image

In resolution technology: 
- CDs and DVDs: By using laser beams with shorter wavelength, we can improve resolving power of the laser and increase the amount of data stored on the discs.
- Electron microscope: Short wavelength of electrons allows electron microscopes to create images with very high resolution.
- Radio telescopes: Radio waves have long wavelengths, so the aperture (satellite dish) needs to be very large for a radio telescope to achieve good resolution. 

### Polarization 
Light is a transverse wave (polarization only occur to transverse waves).
The polarization of light refers to the orientation of the oscillation in the underlying electric field.
Light is plane polarized if the electric field oscillates in one plane.

![[hemem.jpg]]

Left shows unpolarized light and right shows polarized light.
**Polarization by reflection**
When light is transmitted across a boundary between two mediums with different refractive indexes, part of the light is reflected and the remaining part is refracted (for further explanation, see section 4.4).
The light reflected is partially polarized, meaning that it is a mixture of polarized light and unpolarized light.
The extent to which the reflected light is polarized depends on the angle of incidence and the refractive index of the two mediums.
The angle of incidence at which the reflected light is totally polarized is called the Brewster’s angle (ϕ) given by the equation.

$$tan(\theta)=\frac {n_2} {n_1}$$
Where n1 and n2 are the refractive indexes for their respective mediums

When the angle of incidence is equal to Brewster’s angle, the reflected ray is totally polarized and the reflected ray is perpendicular to the refracted ray.

![[yuguygf.jpg]]


Polarizer:
- A polarizer is a sheet of material which polarizes light.
- When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, its intensity is reduced by 50%.

Analyzer:
- When polarized light passes through a polarizer, its intensity will be reduced by a factor dependent on the orientation of the polarizer. This property allows us to deduce the polarization of light by using a polarizer.
- A polarizer used for this purpose is called an analyzer.

Malus’ Law relates the incident intensity and transmitted intensity of light passing through a polarizer and an analyzer.

![[rred.png]]

Where I is the transmitted intensity, I0 is the initial light intensity upon the analyzer, θ is the angle between the transmission axis and the analyzer.

![[huhuijh.gif]]![[fgtrtr.gif]]

When light passes through an optically active substance, the plane of polarization rotates.



## Magnetism 

### Magnets
Ferromagnetic metals such as alloys of iron, nickel, cobalt and gadolinium have a North and South pole. Whereby the each metal is composted of magnetic domains that cause the metal (no matter how small to always have a north and south pole). Common non-ferromagnetic metals include copper and aluminum. If allowed to freely rotate, magnets will align themselves in a north-south direction - or the North pole of the magnet is attracted to the magnetic South pole
> **The law of magnetic poles:** Opposite poles attract each other and similar poles repel each other.
#### Magnetic Fields
The force that magnets exert across distances in space is their magnetic field. It can be detected by using a compass (magnetized needle). It can also be visually seen by placing iron shavings in the presence of a magnetic field.

Magnetic fields for a bar magnet, and two bar magnets:
![[rkugre.png]]
![[ewioeih.png]]
![[VFPt_cylindrical_magnets_repelling.svg.png]]

Geographic vs. magnetic North/South poles of the earth. 
![[poles.png]]
#### Domain Theory of Magnetism
Simply put, magnets are composed of smaller magnets known as magnetic domains, Each domain behaves as a smaller bar magnet. Normally, these domains are randomly scattered but int he presence of a magnetic field, the domains align; this causes the substance to become a temporary magnet.

![[ugyjgj.png]]

Ferromagnetic materials behave magnetically when in a magnetic field. Therefore, if something is attracted to a magnet or affects a compass, all you know is that it is ferromagnetic. You do not know if the material is a permanent magnet. This explains the following phenomena:

1. When a bar magnet is broken into two, the two smaller magnets are produced; a one poled magnet does not exist.
2. Soft iron demagnetizes almost instantly while hard steel to alloys seem to ‘lock’ the aligned domains in position.
3. Heating or dropping a magnet can cause it to lose its magnetism.
4. A strong magnetic field opposite to a magnet can reverse the magnetism in a bar magnet.
5. Stroking it in one direction with a strong magnet can magnetize a needle. This causes the needle’s domains to align.

### Hand Rules 
![[retre.png]]![[43trrert 1.png]]

*The third hand rule is shown later; with Forces:*
#### Solenoids 
If the current is in a coil of conducting wire, the curled fingers of the left hand indicate the circular electron flow and the straight thumb indicates the direction of the straight magnetic field within the coil. The end of the solenoid that the thumb points to behaves like the north pole of a magnet.  The other end behaves like a south pole.  To strengthen the field and create an electromagnet an iron core could be placed in the centre of the solenoid as the domains of the iron align with the field strengthening the field. Note:  If conventional current is used the same rules apply but using the right hand instead of left hand.

![[jkdhkd.png]]
![[jhgkjg.png]]

Adding fields together: 
![[vector-addition-1.gif]]


### Current Electricity 
Electric current is the rate at which a electrons flow through a conductor. The SI unit for current, I is in Amperes I. (For the following formula, q = charge, t =time and is an Alberta non-sense formula).
$$ I=q/t $$
- Electrical circuits: Loops of moving electrical charge
- Conventional current: ‘the flow of positive charge’ through a circuit
- Electron Flow: the flow of negative charge, electrons, through a circuit.


### Magnetic Force
The magnitude of the force acting on a current-carrying wire due to a magnetic field can be given by: 

![[Pasted image 20240702190031.png]]

The equation may be multiplied by sinθ where θ is the angle between the direction of the field and the current. This can be ignored when θ=90 degrees because sin90 degrees equals to 1.
**Magnetic force on a moving charge**
The magnitude of the force acting on a moving charge due to a magnetic field can be given by

$$F=qBv\sin \theta$$
Where $F$ is the force acting on the wire, $B$ is the magnetic field, $q$ is the amount of charge, $v$ is the velocity of the charge, and $\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the field and the velocity.

![[Pasted image 20240702190203.png]]

Remember that the direction of the (conventional) current is the opposite to that of the flow of electrons.

As the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the charge, it acts as a centripetal force (see topic 6) and the charge follows a circular path. No work is done on the charge by the magnetic field.

### Magnetic Forces on a Current Carrying Conductor 
#### Third Hand Rule 
Left hand’s thumb is the direction of negative charge flow (if flow of a proton, use right hand), v. The direction the magnetic field follows the tips of the left hand, B. Finally, the direction of magnetic force comes out of the left hand’s palm.
**Often calculating an unknown using the following formula isn’t too difficult. In order to be awarded full marks, direction is critical ad a third dimension is introduced. In order to find said directions, the third hand rule MUST be used. (When given magnetic field strength, current, and or force)

**This formula only applies if l and B are perpendicular to each other. If they aren't, then their components can be used.

**The SI unit of magnetic field strength is in Teslas, T = kg/(s*C)

$$ F=IlB $$
![[reterred.png]]

#### Magnetic Forces Between Two Current Carrying Conductors:
Currents in the same direction attract each other, and currents flowing in opposite directions repel each other. Additionally the convention to show that there is electron flow going away from the observer (into the page) is to use an x (tails of an arrow); inversely, to show that current is coming towards the observer, a dot is used (tip of an arrow).

![[ertretregds.png]]

### Application of Magnetic Forces 
The rapid change of direction of electron flow, current causes the force acting on the cone to ungulate at the frequency of the switches. The magnetic coil acts like a solenoid, so when the direction of the current switches so do the ’poles’.

![[fdgrere.png]]

The current and the magnetic field (produced by the magnets (stators)) acting on the commutator produce a downwards and upwards force causing the motor to spin to 90 degrees. However to continue the spinning of the motor, the current is cut off, and the commutator is able to move past 90 degrees. After this point, there the current is applied again, and the force is again acting on the ‘edges’ of the commutator; causing it to spin.

![[ewteret4te.png]]

### Charged Particles in a Magnetic Field 
In the formula, $F=Il_⊥B$ The force comes from the cumulative forces on the individual charges. Considering that a charged particle of charge q, is moving perpendicularly through a magnetic field, B the following deduction (formula) should be valid.
$$ I=(nq)/t⠀⠀v=l/t⠀⠀l=vt $$
Using the third hand rule, (where current is ‘replaced’ by speed of a charged particle) the force acting on a particle will always be perpendicular to its motion. → This results in a kind of centripetal force acting on the particle as well as the magnetic force. In order to ‘shoot’ a particle undeviated in a magnetic field, the centripetal force must be equal to the magnetic force (in magnitude).
$$ F_c=|F_m| ⠀→ ⠀(mv^2)/r =qvB⠀ → ⠀(mv)/r =qB $$
![[CNX_UPhysics_28_03_MagCirc.jpg]]
### Mass Spectrometer 
Ions are produced by providing energy into the system - heating or electrical discharge and then accelerated using voltage. The velocity of an accelerated particle can be determined using the following formulas/manipulations:

$$ V=(ΔE/q)⠀⠀,ΔE = E_kf-E_ki =E_kf = 0.5mv^2 $$

![[eiuhei.png]]
$$ 0.5mv_f^2=ΔVq $$

**If mass, charge and voltage are known, the velocity can easily be calculated. If not the formula above needs to be combined with other formulas.

After passing through the accelerating region, the ions then enter a velocity sector region (some problems don’t include this section). The velocity selector consists of perpendicular magnetic and electric field. Only charged particles of the correct charge and speed make it through the selector undeflected. When entering such plates, the following equality is valid:

$$ |F_m|=|F_e|⠀⠀E=Bv $$

After the velocity selector, the ions enter a perpendicular magnetic field and are deflected into a circular path. This is commonly known as the bending region. In this region, the centripetal force on the particle comes from the magnetic force on the moving charge in the magnetic field.

$$ F_m=Fe⠀→⠀qBr = mv $$

![[Untitleduieh32.png]]

### Cyclotron 
A cyclotron is a particle accelerator that is constructed of two hollow metal shells shaped like Ds in a perpendicular magnetic field created by magnets, as shown below. The entire apparatus is placed in a vacuum. An alternating voltage is maintained across the D separation. Positively charged particles such as protons are injected near the centre of the Ds and travel in circular paths caused by the external perpendicular magnetic field. The frequency of the alternating voltage is adjusted to increase the speed of the particles each time they move across the Ds’ separation.

![[Untitlede4iuh4.png]]

### Auroras (Northern Lights)
Tremendous expulsions of magnetic energy from the solar atmosphere, called solar flares, expel streams of charged particles at speeds around 10% of the speed of light.  When some of these particles strike Earth’s magnetic field, they are deflected by the magnetic force and spiral in a helical path along Earth’s magnetic field lines. These particles enter the atmosphere as they approach Earth’s magnetic poles, and collide with air molecules.

Component for velocity gets canceled out.

### Faraday's Law 
**Faraday's law of induction** (or simply **Faraday's law**) is a basic law of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism) predicting how a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field) will interact with an [electric circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_circuit) to produce an [electromotive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force) (emf)—a phenomenon known as [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction). It is the fundamental operating principle of [transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer), [inductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor), and many types of [electric motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor), [generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_generator) and [solenoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction#cite_note-Sadiku386-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction#cite_note-3)

The **Maxwell–Faraday equation** (listed as one of [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations)) describes the fact that a spatially varying (and also possibly time-varying, depending on how a magnetic field varies in time) electric field always accompanies a time-varying magnetic field, while Faraday's law states that there is emf (electromotive force, defined as electromagnetic work done on a unit charge when it has traveled one round of a conductive loop) on the conductive loop when the magnetic flux through the surface enclosed by the loop varies in time.

Faraday's law had been discovered and one aspect of it (transformer emf) was formulated as the Maxwell–Faraday equation later. The equation of Faraday's law can be derived by the Maxwell–Faraday equation (describing transformer emf) and the [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force) (describing motional emf). The integral form of the Maxwell–Faraday equation describes only the transformer emf, while the equation of Faraday's law describes both the transformer emf and the motional emf

### Electromagnetic induction
Magnetic field could cause electrons to move as a current
1. Moving a wire through the jaws of a horseshoe magnet.
2. Plunging a bar magnet into and out of the core of a coil
3. Touching then removing a bar magnet to a core which was inside a coil of wire

#### Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction 
Whenever the magnetic field in the region of a conductor is moving or changing in magnitude, electrons are induced to flow through the conductor. 
#### Faraday's Ring 
![[dtertert.png]]

Before the switch is closed. Switch open therefore no current in the primary therefore no magnetic field therefore no change in field and no induction. When switch gets closed there is a surge in current in the primary therefore a changing flux therefore induced current in one direction in the secondary and in the galvanometer. While switch stays closed there IS current and magnetic flux in the primary however there is NO CHANGING flux therefore no induced current in the secondary. When the switch is opened the current stops in the primary. Domains scatter which is a change in flux which induces current in the secondary in the opposite direction.
#### Direction of induced current/Lenz’s law
Lenz's Law states that the direction of the induced current is such that the magnetic field resulting from the induced current opposes the change in flux that caused the induced current. ** consider Newton’s third law; or in English… Lenz' law says that the direction of the induced current will oppose the change in flux that created it. It's not a matter of increasing and decreasing, it's a matter of direction.

![[Untitledrtyrt.png]]
#### Flux 
![[eih3.png]]

How to turn electricity into magnetism + inverse
### Fuses
**Fuses are placed in the main line of a parallel circuit.  They are designed to melt and break a circuit if too much current goes through them.** As loads are added to the circuit the current through the main line goes up. This current also goes through the fuse. The fuse is rated on how much current can pass through it before it melts and breaks the circuit. For Example, a 12 A fuse will allow up to 12 A of current to travel through the line. Any amount of current exceeding 12 A will cause the fuse to melt therefore breaking the circuit.
### Switches 
Switches. A switch can allow current through a circuit or a portion of a circuit. When a switch is opened no current flows through that line. A switch in the main line is an on off switch for the entire circuit. A switch in a parallel line is an on off switch for that line.







## Electricity 
### Charge 
Matter is composed of atoms which are made of electron, protons and neutrons. Moreover, protons carry a positive charge while electrons carry a negative charge of the same magnitude being the elementary charge (neutrons carry no charge). Protons are fixed to their nucleus whereas electrons are free to travel more freely. Electrons have approximately 1/2000th of the charge that protons carry. Atoms found in their ‘natural state’ have a charge of zero, however if an atom becomes ionized, it can have ‘an extra charge’.

TLDR: Electrons positive, Protons negative and have the same magnitude of charge, on formula sheet
#### Conductors and Insulators 
Electrical conductivity depends on how tightly electrons are bound to the nucleus of an atom. Insulators have electrons that are tightly bound to the nucleus and are not free to travel within the substance. Materials that have electrons on the outermost regions of the atom that are free to travel are conductors.

- Insulator examples: Ebonite (plastic), glass, rubber, pure/distilled H2O
- Conductor examples: Metals, graphite, salt solutions, people, ionized H2O

#### Law of Charges; Conservation of Charges 
Like charges repel, unalike charges attract (Note: If a particle is neutral, it will still be attracted to any charge particle - definition includes this case). The net charge of an isolated system is conserved.
#### Measuring Charge 
The SI unit of charge is a coulomb, C having a symbol of ‘q’.
1 C of negative charge is equivalent to the charge of 6.25*10^18 electrons. The same magnitude applies to protons.
$$ 1.00C = 6.25* 10^{18}⠀elementary⠀charges $$
$$ q_{e/p} = \pm 1.60*10^{-19}C $$
![[jkhgjhgkg.png]]

#### Methods of Charging Objects: 
##### Charging by Friction 
When materials are rubbed together, electrons can transfer from the material that holds it electrons loosely to a material that holds onto the electrons tightly -charge is conserved. Ex. charging ebonite using fur, the negative charge gained (negative lost) by the fur. Additionally, it produces oppositely charged objects.

The larger the difference of how tightly an electron is held on to by a given material correlates to how easily electron transfer can occur via charging objects by friction.

![[5665y56.png]]

##### Charging by Conduction 
Objects can become charged by the transfer of electrons from a charged object to an uncharged object by simply touching the objects together. This produces similarly charged objects. If conductors of different sizes are touched together, the object with the larger surface area takes more charge. The voltage will equalize.
##### Charging by Induction
Induction is a process in which charges in a neutral object shift or migrate because of the presence of an external charged object. This temporary charge separation polarizes the neutral object. One side of the object becomes positively charged and the other side is equally negatively charged.

In order for an object to retain its charge through induction, a path for the electrons to leave the object must be provided.
Negative rod is brought near the grounded conductor; ground is removed, negative rod is removed. This will produce a charged object using induction.

![[jgmjhbgk.png]]
![[ygjgjh.png]]
##### Electroscopes 
Whenever a negatively charged object such as a negatively charged rod is brought near a neutral electroscope, the negative charges in the electroscopes are repelled away from the rod. Making the ‘top’ of the electroscope have a positive net charge. **Generally, electroscopes show the presence of charge within an object.**

![[fyjfjygfj.png]]

### Coulomb's Law 
Coulomb’s law is used to measure to electrostatic force between two point charges. This was determined through the usage of a torsion balance similar to Cavendish’s model when investigating gravitational force between two masses. The following equation was determined by determining the proportionality given constant variables:

$$ F_e = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2} $$

Where electrostatic force, $F_e$., Coulomb’s constant, $k = 8.99*10^9 Nm^2/C^2$, charges of the spheres (point charges) , $q_1, q_2$, distance between centres of spheres, $r$

1D questions and 2D questions are often asked. If asking to determine the electrostatic force on a sphere on a plane, use vectors to determine $\sum F_e$

![[uheih4.png]]
![[Untitledgfh.png]]
#### Arcing:
If electrical charge present in an object becomes significant enough, it can pass through the air and force it to act as a conductor would. This process is ‘arcing’. This is an example of conduction not induction as electrical charge actually transfers from one object to another.

Electric charge can either be positive or negative.
Charges with the same sign repel each other and changes with the opposite sign attract.

![[ghfjfjf.gif]]

An object with equal amounts of positive change and negative charge is said to be electrically neutral.
The unit of electric charge is coulomb (C).
The charge of one electron is equal to 1.6*10^-19C.
Electric charge is always conserved. While charges could migrate from one body to another, the total charge remains the same.

Conductors are materials which allow the passage of electric charge. This is due to the presence of free electrons in solid conductors.
- Examples of conductors include all metals, graphite, humans.
Insulators are materials which do not allow the passage of electric charge.
- Examples of insulators include wood, glass, and plastic buckets.

### Electric Field 
Similarly to how masses have gravitational fields, charges have electromagnetic fields. Electric field intensity, $\vec{E}$ is the ratio of the force an electric field puts on a positive test charge over the size of a test charge, $q'$. Where a test charge is a point charge whose charge is small enough to not affect the field its placed in. The SI units of electric field intensity are measured in N/C. **Not a kind of Energy.
$$ |\vec{E}|=\frac{\vec{F_{on⠀q'}}}{q'} $$
The direction of the magnetic field is drawn such that it reflects the direction of force on a positive charge when placed in an object’s magnetic field.

When the formula for electric field strength is combined with the formula for electrostatic force on an object, the following formula is formed. (One of the point charges cancels out
$$ |\vec{E}|=\frac{F_e}{q} $$
#### Drawing field lines:
As mentioned earlier, field lines are drawn towards the negatively charged point/area. Using this the following diagrams are made:
![[https___haygot.s3.amazonaws.com_443_cheatsheet_16778_5ffd55a346584a67aaf64b8af35b3750.png]]

![[CNX_UPhysics_22_06_P2ans_img 1.jpg]]



Electric fields can be graphically represented as electric field lines.
- The direction of the field at a point is equal to the direction of the field line passing through that point (arrows from the positive pole to the negative pole).
- The magnitude of the field at a point corresponds to the density of the field lines around that point. For a uniform electric field, the field lines are straight, parallel and equally spaced.

Non-uniform electric field
![[hjjhvkjv.gif]]

#### Uniform Electric Field
![[fthttrhrt.jpg]]

The electric field lines curve outwards near the edge of the plates. This is known as the “edge effect”.
Electric field strength (E) is the force per unit charge experienced by a positive test change placed in a field.

To describe the attraction between two charged particles Coulomb's Law is used: 
$$F=k\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}$$
Where $F$ ($N$) is the force, $k$ is $8.99\times 10^9 \frac {Nm^2}{r^2}$, $q_1$ and $q_2$ ($C$) are the charge of the two objects (usually the same when considering two electrons), and $r$ is the radius/distance between the two charges ($m$).

Therefore, since $F = qE = k \frac {q_1q_2}{r^2}$ we can deduce that for non-uniform electric fields, the electric field strength can be calculated by
$$E=k\frac {|Q|}{r^2}$$
![[jhh 1.gif]]

by cancelling out q (charge) on both sides.
For uniform electric fields, the electric field strength can be calculated by: 
$$E=\frac V d$$
![[Pasted image 20240702182210.png]]

#### Special Situations 
Around an irregularly shaped conductor, the magnetic field strength at a ‘sharp’ point is greater than the surrounding field strength of the object.: 

![[kjkjhk.png]]

Inside a hollow conductor, there is no electrostatic field present.

![[Untitledukhk.png]]

For parallel plates, the Electric field strength is constant at all points inside the plates. **Electric field wraps around the plates which is not depicted in the diagram.

![[schematic_diagram_of_parallel_plate_capacitor4375521119042355655.jpg]]

In order to suspend a charge in an electric field, there would need to be an equal but opposite electrostatic force to counteract the gravitational force downwards. This can be done only because there is an average/constant/uniform electrostatic field

$$ F_g = -F_e $$

There are also Parallel plate questions involving voltage and distance + parabolic motion.




### Voltage 
#### Electrical Potential Difference 
Similarly to how and object has gravitational potential energy when their above the surface of a much larger mass, measures gravitational potential energy/unit mass, point charges act similarly; as when work is done to move the smaller positive charge away from the object against the conservative electrostatic force, the work done increases the electrical potential energy.

![[rererger.png]]![[reggregrereg.png]]

Electric potential difference (AKA electrical potential difference, potential difference or potential) is the change in electric potential energy per unit charge, measured in voltage, $\Delta V$, SI units:
$$V = A*\Omega = \frac{W}{A}=\frac{J}{C}=\frac{kg*m^2}{s^3*C}$$
The electric potential difference (pd) between two points is equal to the work done (energy) required per unit charge to move from one point to another. It is also known as voltage (V).
#### Charged Particle in an Electrical Field
If charged particles can move freely in an electric field, the electric potential energy can be converted to kinetic energy of the moving particle. Note: For small particles such as electrons and protons, the space they move in must be evacuated from air, as air particles would collide with the moving charged particles and rob them of their kinetic energy.

Electron volts: An electron volt (eV) is the quantity of energy an electron gains or loses when passing through a potential difference of exactly 1V. One electron volt is significantly smaller then one joule.

$$ |\vec{E}| = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}⠀⠀\Delta V= \frac W q $$

Where $E$= electric field, $\Delta V$ = voltage, $d$ = displacement, $\Delta d$ =point charge $W (\Delta E)$ = work, change in energy.

#### Parabolic motion of a charged point

**Use kinematics formulas + new ones together AND don’t forget $F=ma$

### Current 


The existence of an electric potential difference (see the last section of 5.1) across an object causes charges to flow through the object.
Electric current (I) refers to the rate of flow of electric charge and can be given by the equation: 
$$I = \frac Q t$$
Where $I$ is the current, $Q$ is the total charge, and $t$ is the time taken. 
The direction of an (conventional) electric current is opposite to the direction of electron flow.

![[ugkkugk.gif]]
### Direct Current (DC)
Direct current (DC) is a uniform current flowing in one fixed direction in a circuit.
Direct current is usually supplied by acid-based batteries or dry cells.

## Circuits 
### Electromotive Force and Current

Within a battery, a chemical reaction occurs that transfers electrons from one terminal (leaving the battery positively charged) to another terminal (leaving negatively charged). Because of the positive and negative charges of the terminals, an electric potential difference exists between them. The maximum potential difference is the electromotive force, $emf, \mathscr{E}$. If a battery were to have 12V labelled as its voltage, it would really represent its $emf$ and is often higher than the actual voltage of the battery/power source.

For instance, common appliances are typically power rated; a power rating is the amount of power an appliance will dissipate under normal operation. E.g. a 100-Watt light bulb dissipated 100 Watts when wire in parallel across 120 volts (Standard household potential)

In a circuit, the battery creates an electric field within and parallel to the wire, directed from the positive end of the terminal to the negative end of the terminal. The electric field exerts a force on the free electrons inside the wire, and they respond by moving. This flow of charge is the electrical current, $I$. Which is defined as the amount of charge per unit time that crosses an imaginary surface. (Can be thought of as a the amount of water crossing a cross section of a river per unit time) Electric current is the rate of flow of electrical charge through a conductive material; this is measured in Amperes, A (SI unit)

$$ I=\frac q t $$

An electrical circuit is a closed loop of moving electrical charges.
Whereas a conventional current is the flow of Positive charges through a circuit, an electron flow is the flow of negative charges through a circuit. [Default used/convention is conventional current]
If the rate of flow is not constant the formula above gives the average current.
If the current is a ‘direct current’, DC, (the same kind produced by batteries), then charge moves around the circuit in one direction at all times.
If the current is an ‘alternating current’, AC, (the same kind produced by generators), then charges move one way then the opposite, in very quick succession.
Ammeters measure the amount of electrical current. In order for ammeters to measure current correctly they should be in placed into the circuit such that current travels through the ammeter at the position where the current needs to be measured. [The ideal ammeter has 0 resistance]
Voltmeters measure the electric potential difference between two points in a circuit. This means they need to be wired across 2 points in a circuit (typically across a power supply or a resistor (load)) [The ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance ]

### Ohm’s law
The current that a battery can push through a wire is analogous to the water flow that a pump can push through a pipe. Greater pump pressures lend larger flows of water; similarly, greater battery voltages lend to larger electrical currents. $I\alpha V$. Additionally the rate at which water flows through a pipe is also affected by the length and diameter of the pipe. Longer and narrower pipes offer more resistance to the moving water, leading to smaller flowing rates. This translates to the electrical resistance of a wire. The electrical resistance of a wire is the ratio of $\frac V I$. For many materials R remains constant over a wide range of voltages and currents. (Not true for light bulbs) Resistivity is measured in Ohms. The following equation illustrates this equivalency:

$$ R =\frac V I⠀⠀1\Omega = \frac {1V} A $$

Materials that have a constant resistance for a wide range of voltages and currents are ohmic resistors, i.e. they obey ohms law. Likewise, materials that have changing resistance over a range of voltages and currents are called non-ohmic resistors, as they don’t obey ohms law.
For a wide range of materials, the resistance of a piece of material is directly proportional to the length, L and inversely proportional to the cross sectional area, A.
Ohm’s law is not a fundamental law of nature (like newton’s laws of gravitation, or the other 3). It is only a statement that describes how electric circuits behave.
Based on the extent that a wire offers resistance to the flow of charges, it can be called a resistor. Unless labelled, wires are assumed to have no resistance. They are generally used to limit the amount of current and establish proper voltage levels.

### Resistance and Resistivity
In a water pipe, the length and cross sectional area of the pipe determine the resistance that the pipe offers to the flow of water. Additionally for the equation listed below, $\rho$ is the proportionality constant known as the resistivity of the material; this is where the analogy falls apart, as based on the material of the wire, the resistivity is going to change based off of its chemical structure. This translates to the resistance of the wire, with the aforementioned variables to the following formula:

$$ R=\rho \frac L A $$

Additionally, when other formulas can be combined to create proportionalities such as:

$$ R ⠀\alpha⠀ L ⠀⠀⠀R⠀\alpha⠀\frac 1 A $$

The resistivity of a material also depends on its temperature. Where $\rho, \rho_0$ are the resistivities of $T,T_0$ respectively. The term $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistivity; it is positive for conductors, negative for insulators. When the first equation is multiplied by $L/A$, the second equation is found.

$$ \rho = \rho_0 (1+\alpha(T-T_0)) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀R=R_0(1+\alpha(T-T_0)) $$

### Electric Power

One of the most important functions of the current in an electric circuit is to transfer energy from a source (such as a battery or a generator) to an electrical device. When an amount of positive charge, $\Delta q$, moves from the higher potential to the lower potential terminal, its electrical potential decreases. As the change in energy per unit time is the power, $P$, the electric power associated with this change can be expressed through the following equation (SI unit in Watts, W):

$$ P=\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t} =\frac{(\Delta q)V}{\Delta t}=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}*V =IV $$

$$ P=IV=I(IR)=I^2R=\frac{V}{R}*R=\frac {V^2} R $$

$$ P=IV⠀⠀P=\frac{V^2} R $$

*The last formula is used only when the power is dissipated by a resistor with a potential difference of V across it.*
### Series Wiring 
Series that contain several devices and are wired such that the same amount of electric current goes through every device. In general the voltage across all the resistors in series is the sum of the individual voltages across each resistor. A series circuit is one in which all power supplies and loads are in a single path, meaning that all current goes through each load. (In series = all elements are successive)

When resistors are in series, the sum of all resistors is the resistance for the whole system; This only applies to devices in series; devices in parallel use a different formula.

![[00082.png]]

$$R_s = R_1+R_2+R_3+...+R_n$$
### Parallel Wiring 
A parallel circuit is one in which each power supply and load is wired to a separate path in the circuit. Such that there is equal voltage distributed across all devices.

![[ugugjuj.png]]

When two resistors, $R_1$ and $R_2$ are configurated in a parallel circuit, each receives current from the power supply as if the other resistor wasn’t present. According to the definition of resistance, $R=V/I$, a larger current implies smaller resistance. Thus the two parallel resistors behave as a single equivalent resistance that is smaller than either $R_1$ or $R_2$. (The cross sectional area of $A_1+A_2$ allows for more current to flow than two separate currents would)

As in a series circuit, it is possible to replace a parallel combination of resistors with an equivalent resistor that results in the same total current and power for a given voltage as the original combination. To determine the equivalent resistance for the two resistors use the following formula (derivation first):

$$ I =I_1+I_2 = \frac V{R_1}+\frac V{R_2}=V(\frac 1{R_1}+\frac 1{R_2}) =V(\frac 1{R_P}) $$

Where $R_P$ is the equivalent resistance. Hence when two resistors are connected in parallel, the following statement can be made: The total current from the voltage source is the sum of the currents in the individual resistors.

$$ \frac 1{R_P}= \frac 1{R_1}+\frac 1{R_2}+\frac 1{R_3}+...\frac 1{R_n} $$

In general, the power delivered to any number of resistors in parallel is equal to the power delivered to the equivalent resistor (which allows for replacement).

### Combinational; Complex Wiring 
![[fjkhjkwehke.png]]
In order to solve these kinds of problems, simplify the circuit until all parallel portions can be ‘simplified’ into a circuit entirely in series.

![[ewrwrwrwe.png]]
![[sdvfssdfsd.png]]
### Fuses 
Fuses are placed in the main line of a parallel circuit. They are designed to burn and melt if too much current goes through them; these are often used to ensure that things don’t burn out.

![[yjjgyjg.png]]

Why wire things in series?

To split the voltage. This is often called a voltage divider. Batteries tend to come in standard voltages that may end up being too large for the circuitry you are operating. Putting a resistor in parallel with your circuitry splits the voltage by having the added resistor take a portion of the voltage.

Why wire things in parallel? This is the standard for most circuits. Wiring things in parallel allows for the greatest power to be used in the circuit. Each parallel line can be separately controlled by switches without affecting the other parallel lines giving more control. Switches in a series circuit or the main line of a parallel circuit shut off power to everything.

### Internal Resistance
Batteries and generators add some resistance to a circuit; this is internal resistance (terminal voltage). As mentioned earlier, every power source has at least a little resistance and this is illustrated the diagram below.

![[kgjhj.png]]
### Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law; Loop Law
Around any complete path through an electrical circuit, the sum of the increases in electrical potential (from batteries, generators etc.) is equal to the sum of the decreases in electrical potential (through various resistances loads); Net voltage, $\sum V_k = 0$

*The energy lost to the resistor in a circuit are equal to the voltage of the battery*

![[jhghjgj.png]]
### Kirchhoff’s Current Law
At any junction point in an electrical circuit, the total current into the junction is equal to the total electrical output of the junction.
** Both relate to the law of conservation of charge and energy for an isolated system.

![[hgfgh.png]]

### Multiloop Circuits 
In situations where there are more than one power supply, Kirchhoff’s laws need to be applied. Identify a direction for the possible loops that may arise. If chosen incorrectly, it will show up in work. (Current will be negative; in the opposite direction)

It is recommended to chose the outer loop or the loop with the most voltage.

### Potential Dividers 
![[ewrwerwd.png]]

A potential divider is a circuit that uses resistors to supply a variable voltage to a device. They are used to dim lights, adjust temperature, audio etc.
### Drift Velocity 
A solid piece of metal, APT consists of metal ions, arranged in a particular pattern, a crystal lattice. The electrons in the meatal are freely moving between the ions. The motion of the free electrons is random ‘Brownian motion’ We say they have random thermal motion with an average speed which increases with temperature.

If a potential difference is applied between two points in the conductor, an electric field is produced. As a consequence, an electric force will act on the charge carriers then another motion is added to the random thermal motion. Additionally the charge carriers will drift along the conductor and a steady charge will flow through the conductor.

- This results in a drift velocity.
- 
![[yuuuy.png]]

![[hkjkhhjkhjk.png]]

The value of the drift speed is usually very small, in everyday situations, $v\approx 10^{-4} m/s$ Additionally, the electric current arising from the movement of a given number of charge carriers through a conductor uses the following formula:

$$ I=nAvq $$

Where $n$= number of charge carriers per unit volume i.e. charge density ($m^{-3}$),  $A$ = cross sectional area of the conductive material ($m^2$), $v$ = average drift speed of charge carriers ($m/s$), $q$ = charge of the carriers

## Electromagnetism 
### Maxwell’s properties:

1. EMR waves are produced whenever electric charges are accelerated. The accelerated charged lose energy that is carried away in EMR waves.
2. if the electric charge is accelerated in periodic motion, the frequency of said motion is also the frequency of the EMR emitted.
3. EMR consists of oscillating electric and magnetic waves in constant phase relation; they are both perpendicular to each other as well as perpendicular to the wave’s propagation
4. All EMR travels at the speed of light, c =3.00 x 10^8 m/s and obey the equation $c = f\lambda$
5. EMR waves exhibit properties of reflection, diffraction, interference, refraction and polarization [polarization is evidence that EMR is transverse]

### Heinrich Hertz:

Hertz was the first person to intentionally produce and detect EMR. This was done by using an induction coil to produce a spark across a gap. Hertz was able to detect a spark jumping across the same type of gap on a wire across the room. - The receiver must be in the same orientation as the transmitter and the light is polarized in the orientation of the receiver.

image

The changing electric field produced by the spark between the gap points created an EMR wave that travelled across the room to the open gap. When the wave arrived at the other loop, the changing magnetic field in the wave induced a spark across the second gap because of the strong electric field induced.

Materials which allow electrons to flow through them are conductors. Materials that don’t are insulators. Semi conductors are materials that are good conductors under certain circumstances. Superconductors are materials that allow for conduction with very little resistance.
### The charge of the atom:

All matter is composed of atoms, and atoms are composed of three types of particles:

- Positively charged protons, p+
- Negatively charged electrons, e-
- Neutral neutrons, n0

The overall charge of an atom is neural (there are the same amount of electrons as protons)
As opposite charges attract, like charges repel. This is similar to a bar magnet.
It is only possible (viably at least) to remove/add electrons from its atom and create an ion
Law of conservation of charge: The total amount of charge present before two objects touch or otherwise interact, remains the same after said interaction.
