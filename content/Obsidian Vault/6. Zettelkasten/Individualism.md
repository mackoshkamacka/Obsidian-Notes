Individualism is the belief that people should be primarily concerned with satisfying their personal interests and goals instead of the collective goals. There is an emphasis on self-determination and working in and for an individual's interests. Because of this, there is an association with individualism with [[Right-wing]] politics. The stark opposite of individualism is [[Collectivism]]. 
### Principles of Individualism 
P = Private property (Something owned by an individual = real estate, physical and intellectual property)
R = Rule of Law (No matter an individual's disposition, they are equal before the law; meaning that everybody is held equally accountable - a murder of or by a millionaire is the same as one to or by a homeless person). ** Though this is rarely respected. 
I = Individual Rights and Freedoms (Rule of law is consequential, this principle is beneficial; everyone has the same entitlement to rights and freedoms). ** Similarly disrespected. 
C = Competition (The emergent effect of [[Capitalism]], where "efficiency" encourages harder work and "proportional" compensation for innovation)
E = Economic Freedom (Freedom to buy and sell labor - in a free market economy this can look like: business freedom, trading freedom, tax freedom, no government regulations, labor freedom, investment freedom, property rights etc.)
S = Self-Interest (Acting to benefit one's personal interests over a common good)
