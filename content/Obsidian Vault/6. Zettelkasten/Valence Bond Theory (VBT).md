# Hybrid(ized) orbitals
When thinking of electrons as particles, representing bonds as dots or lines makes sense, however, once they are expressed as waves, new definitions of bonds are needed. This is where hybridized orbitals provide some clarity: if electrons can be represented as a wave, then superimposing them would result in a new region being formed. If the waves are constructive, the region formed is a covalent bond; if there is destructive interference, then there is a node (a region where the likelihood of an electron being in that region is 0).

Hybrid orbitals are only formed in bonding. They take the intermediate energy between s and p orbitals. The shape of the hybridized orbital is still a probability function.

There is a hybridization of atomic orbitals to form bond orbitals. This discovery is attributed to Linus Pauling.

## Types of Hybrid Orbitals

### Linear Orbitals ($sp$ Hybridization)
Linear orbitals have $sp$ hybridization. These orbitals allow for two bonding sites, and have a linear geometry. In $sp$ hybridization, there is often a triple bond. This often creates 2 $\pi$ bonds as a triple bond creates a linear chain of the bonded carbons.

### Trig. Planar Orbitals ($sp^2$ Hybridization)
Trigonal planar orbitals have $sp^2$ hybridization. These orbitals allow for three bonding sites, and have a trigonal planar geometry.

In 1,1,2,2-tertamethylethene, the sigma double bond between $C=C$ brings together the hydrogen attached to both carbons involved. This proximity creates a $\pi$ bond. → Pi bonds

### Tetrahedral Orbitals ($sp^3$ Hybridization)
Tetrahedral orbitals have $sp^3$ hybridization. These orbitals allow for four bonding site, and have a tetrahedral geometry. For this kind of hybridization, there are four possible orbital.

Methane, $CH_4$ for example, has 4 $sp^3$ orbitals. Typically, carbon can only have two bonds, but with the introduction of the $sp^3$ orbital, the two electrons in the $2s$ orbital go to two of the empty $sp^3$ orbitals.

The energy level of this orbital is between that $2p$ orbital’s and the $2s$ orbital’s. This creates 4 bonding orbitals with 25% s character (1:3=1/4 of the orbitals are $s$orbitals) and 75% $p$ character (3:1=3/4 of the orbitals are $p$. So the overall energy level is 75% the way to $p$ from $s$.

## Sigma ($\sigma$) & Pi ($\pi$) Bonds
### Sigma Bonds
Sigma bonds are covalent bonds and have end-to-end overlapping orbitals. To describe the bonding of the $H-C$ in $CH_4$, take the orbital of the hydrogen, $s$, put a dash between it and the hybridized $C$ orbital, $sp^3$: $H-C$= $s-sp^3$.

### Pi Bonds
Pi bonds are created when a sigma bond brings 2 lobes of electron density together; creating an axis that would overlap above. For a side by side view, there would be an overlap of 2-unhybrydized p-orbitals. close together. In 1,1,2,2-tertamethylethene, the sigma double bond between $C=C$ brings together the hydrogen attached to both carbons involved. This proximity creates a $\pi$ bond.

- Double bonds = $1\sigma + 1\pi$
- Triple bonds = $1\sigma + 2\pi$

### Delocalized $\pi$ bonds
A delocalized $\pi$ bond is a bond that is spread across 3 or more atoms (each of these atoms must have an unhybridized $p$ orbital). For example: Benzene has a delocalized $\pi$ bond above and below because each carbon has delocalized $p$ orbitals.

In resonance structures, the $\pi$ bond is delocalized because it is perpetually moving between single bonds. This is true for resonance structures e.g. Ozone, $O_3$
