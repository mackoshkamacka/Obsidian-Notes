AKA: Mass sociogenic illness, mass psychogenic disorder, epidemic hysteria, [[Mass hysteria]]

The mass spread of illness symptoms through a population where no infectious agent is identified for the contagion. Wherein the symptoms originate from a nervous system disturbance - involving excitation, loss, or alteration of function - and result in the [[unconsciousness]] exhibiting what the nervous system believes to be happening to the body. Therefore there is no organic cause for symptoms. This lends to the [[Hyper-medicalization]] of very normal emotions.
