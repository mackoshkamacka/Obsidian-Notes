### Savagery, Barbaric States Improved by "Legitimate (Benevolent) Despotism"
Mill argues that freedom of conscious, expression and conduct (behavior) should be free from state coercion except in cases where an actor causes harm. He then argues that his own arguments are irrelevant in cases where “backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage,” harm and state coercion are permissible. He is excusing slavery and colonization: British colonization of India, Nigeria, and Jamaica for example. This is a contradiction.

> "Mill's argument for benevolent despotism failed to appreciate that neither colonialism nor benevolent despotism is ever benevolent. Benevolence here is the commitment to seek the happiness from others. but the mission of colonialism is exploitation and domination of the colonized generally, and Europeanization at least of those among the colonized whose class position makes it possible economically and educationally  - and a mandate of despotism ... is to assume absolute power to achieve the ruler's self-interested ends. Thus colonial despotism could achieve happiness of colonized Others only by imposing the measure of Europeanized marks of happiness upon the Other, which is to say, to force the Other to be less so."

#### Counter Argument 
It is true that this contradiction undermines Mill’s argument as a whole, but this part of his argument is tangential and can be removed from his argument entirely. Without his prejudice, a consistent argument is still apparent. This points out a contradictory prejudice and does not dismantle his argument. 

Mill also views imperialism as a kind of improvement to the lives to these barbarian states. = Tolerant imperialism - colonial powers determine when a nation is fit to govern itself, by making itself a lucrative market only then can they better society = a capitalist  stance. 
To remedy these concerns 

Change Mill's definition of improved society/anti-harm away from a purely capitalist lens, and acknowledge that these supposed barbarians are capable progress without imperialist reign. 

Mill's position outside the point of barbarians is the reason why supposed legitimate despotism ought to be condemned.
