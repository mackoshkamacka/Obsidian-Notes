### Overview
Many believe that the Cold War would not have happened if it were not for nuclear weapons. The sentiment follows that: because neither the USSR nor the US would be willing to launch a large scale attack on each other (at best achieving a Pyrrhic victory and at worst suffering a decimation), they employed other methods to psychologically and tactically destroy the other. This happened through proxy wars (e.g. the Vietnam War), … That is not to say that the threat of nuclear war did not exist; in fact there were several instances where this almost happened.

Every country on the Earth was directly affected by the Cold War in some way. It shaped the decolonization of European colonies; empires; shaped domestic politics across the world. It destabilized global relations, changed the lives of Americans, and caused global harm. Even today, Putin’s worldview has been shaped by the way in which the USSR collapsed in the 1990s. The Cold War was the first war that had the possibility of ending in apocalypse, leaving a profound psychological terror worldwide. What made the Cold War especially terrifying was not only the threat of complete destruction at the hands of nuclear weapons, but the ideological opposition to the other's way of life. This struggle between the nations built around the irreconcilable [[Capitalism]] and [[Communism]]. 

On March 5th, 1946 Winston Churchill declared that the Soviet Union sought to block itself out from the West in a supposed, “Iron Curtain” that now divided Europe. The Iron Curtain refers to the non-official border that divided states under Western influence, and states under Soviet influence. The animosity felt between the two sides was rooted in events till The Russian Revolution of 1917. Disagreements, annexation of European states, etc. upset western influences such as [[Warsaw Pact]], and [[NATO]]. Physically, the Iron Curtain existed as a border of defense of the countries who were afraid of invasion, and sought a defense. An example of such a defense was the [[Berlin wall]], the “Checkpoint Charlie” of Central Europe and the Iron Curtain generally. The Iron Wall was held until the end of the Cold War in 1991, and symbolized the efforts made by the Soviet Union to isolate itself (and satellite states) from making contact with non-Soviet states (NATO states, and non-Soviet controlled states).
### Pre-WWII
As mentioned, antagonism between the Soviet Union and the West started after the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917: The Allied Powers and The Central Powers supported the White Movement who opposed the Bolsheviks (Reds), during the Russian Civil War of 1918-1920. However, as WWII was approaching, the antagonism turned to the Nazis but was not forgotten. Tensions quickly rose again as Soviet desperation, poor military organization, famine etc. led to a temporary truce between the Nazis and the Soviets.

This in conjunction with the Soviet-German Pact (also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of non-aggression signed days before WWII - perceived to be cooperation with the enemy), Atlantic Charter (a doctrine that _threatened_ communist ideals by promoting self-determination, democracy, isolationism, and a very capitalistic version of economic cooperation. One can argue that this economically and socially divided the rift between the east and west), [[Morgenthau Plan]], and [[Marshall Plan]] (economic dependency on the west being a kind of allyship, which would be useful given the proximity to the Soviet Union) to support the reconstruction of German industry. 
### Post-WWIII 
#### Rush to Devastate What's Left of the Enemy 
Soon after troops defeated Germany, the [[American Development of the Atomic Bomb]] was continued in the [[Manhattan Project]] by the US to completely end Japanese resistance to unconditional surrender. This, while demonstrating military might to the rest of the world, was done to prevent the USSR from exerting communist influence on Japan. This is where some historians say that the beginning of the Cold War began, as the unnecessary amount of force used in the [[Japanese Bombings]] was done to prevent USSR glory more than to defeat an enemy. Both in the [[Early Military Uses of the Nuclear Bomb]] and the [[Rush to Build the First Atomic Bomb]], the US's desperation to create this weapon successfully intimidated the USSR. 
#### Dividing the Spoils 
This raised the tension as during the [[Yalta Conference]], the major powers of the world sought to divide what was left of it. In a follow-up conference, [[Potsdam Conference]] the fear of Stalin began to rise in the West as it became clear that Stalin sought to promote Russian influence and protect communism - spheres of influence. Truman aimed to promote and protect democracy, freedom and capitalism. For context, see the [[Development of Communism in the USSR]]. Stalin was seeking to reap the rewards from Germany, as he believed "I didn't lose 20 million just to get nothing": The [[Truman Doctrine]] was established to prevent Soviet influence. Although the [[Morgenthau Plan]] fell through, the [[Marshall Plan]] sought to help recover the German economy and build a capitalist reliance to the same effect. The Marshall Plan was countered with [[COMECON]] and the [[Molotov Plan]].   
#### Dividing the World 
[[Stalin's post war aims]], Kennan's involvement established the USSR as an adversary. This led to the [[National Security Act - US]] and the mainstream fear of communist spread: Churchill gave his [[Iron Curtain Speech]], and heightened tension between the divided nations: [[Iron curtain]]. Then the Soviets tried to take over the entirety of Western Berlin with the [[Berlin blockade]]. This more direct economic interference led to the formation of [[NATO]] (voluntary alliance). This was done to prevent the spread of communism ([[Domino theory]]). As a direct response, the USSR created the [[Warsaw Pact]] (compulsory alliance). With [[Mao Zedong's communist China]], cooperation between the USSR and China spread the idea that communism was spreading internationally and militarizing. This "loss" of China instigates the Red hysteria ([[Red Scare]]) that poison our modern politics. There was a real sense that the Cold War was being lost to communism. 
#### Threat of Internal Communism
The [[Soviet Development of the Atomic Bomb]] had even developed their first atomic weapon far sooner than expected, as a response to the US's display of intimidation in the [[Japanese Bombings]], by essentially copying the Manhattan Project. The espionage involved in this case led to the widespread belief that anyone could be a spy, anyone could be a communist. People who look like me, talk like me and think like me may be a communist was a genuine fear people had. Thus starting [[House of Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)]], [[McCarthyism]] in the US, and the [[Red Scare]] radicalized many Americans. This with the further development of nuclear weapons to the point where leaders realized that using these weapons would lead to the end of civilization.
