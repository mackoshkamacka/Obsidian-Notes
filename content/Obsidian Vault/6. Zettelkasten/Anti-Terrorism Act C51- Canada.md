The Anti-Terrorism Act gives police wide, sweeping powers to act on suspected acts of terrorism. Similar to the [[Patriot Act - US]], this Act was passed to combat terrorists. It makes it easier for the police to use electronic surveillance, which used to be seen as a last resort; it allows for preventative arrests; it allows for the designation of a group as a terrorist organization; (the two points that were not renewed in 2007 were the clauses that allowed judges to compel witnesses to give evidence during an investigation, and allowed for suspected terrorists to be detained without charge for up to 3 days).
