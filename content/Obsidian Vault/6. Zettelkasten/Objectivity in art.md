Anything objective is useful in subjective application 
If art has application (inspiration, motivation, personal fulfillment), there can be objective art.
It's role with convention - what it has to say = a statement 
Art is created to share 
When art does not have subjective value, it becomes 'stupid/bad/derivative' this kind of art is morally offensive to the viewer = derivative, and corruptive form of art that WILL or HAS ruined the artistic landscape 

Justifying why art is bad via critique -> personal attack -> Justifying identity -> with leisure time, time that is meant for expression is wasted on 'bad art' -> leisure = an exercise in freedom 

Delicacy and refined tastes -> art should be review over time -> the more someone indulges art, the more refined their taste -> art has a more specific and specialized utility/objectivity. [[Hume]]. 

Pragmatism 

Cultural objectivity and fact 

The more the art is articulated, the more it becomes 'real' and objective.
