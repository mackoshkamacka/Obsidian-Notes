#### Definitions
When people use medical terms inaccurately, and or make medical assumptions that are actively detrimental. In an attempt to intellectualize their and other people's emotions and social interactions, it is insensitive to call someone x, as a non-psychologist/psychiatrist when x people or people with x actively struggle with these psychological issues. In fact it may make relating to such emotions and interactions more difficult as if something is seen as x and someone doesn't have x, they will reasonably distance themself from said emotion and or state. The people who do relate to these very normal states and emotions supposedly have x. This has resulted in [[Mass psychogenic illness (MPI)]] - people exhibiting symptoms of AuDHD without being diagnosed and 'growing out of it.'
