The greatest integer function is also known as the floor function (basically states that the real number, $x$ and "rounds it down" to the nearest integers). Instead of using the notation $[x]$, the floor function typically has the notation: $\lfloor x \rfloor$. 

Similarly, to the floor function, the ceiling function rounds $x$ to the next integer value, with the notation: $\lceil x \rceil$. 
Example: $\lceil 5/2 \rceil = 3; (2.5 \to 3)$ and $\lceil -5/2 \rceil = -2; (-2.5 \to -2)$.
