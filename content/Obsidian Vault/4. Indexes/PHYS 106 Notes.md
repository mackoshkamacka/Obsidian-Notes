##### Introduction (Lecture 1) 
*What is physics*
	The goal of physics is to observe the universe and to understand its rules. 
	* "Workings of everything in the universe are governed by a few simple basic principles = elegant mathematical rules" [[Occam's Razor]] [[Empiricism]]
	* We have managed to understand these rules (mostly) + how to manipulate these rules to our advantage. 
		* Predict the future (outcomes and experiments)
		* Deduce the past
		* Design technology 

###### Describing a Universe
To determine the rules of the universe we must: 
1. Have a mathematical description of possible configurations of the system.
	* E.g. In the happy face example: a 2D, discrete time intervals, periodic (torus) is the environment/ and observation. 
2. Understand the rules for evolution/propagation: Can predict all future configurations given
	* In the happy face example: Initial velocity $(x_0,y_0)$, the initial velocity, clockwise by $90 \degree$ (on a gray tile), next position = current position + velocity, next velocity (if white = previous velocity, if gray current velocity rotated clockwise).

###### Coordinates of an Object
This is similar to the universe we live in where: the previous state of an object is contingent on the environment, previous states etc. in the field of [[Classical mechanics]]. This is true for Euclidean geometry, but on larger scales, with larger masses, this falls apart according to [[Relativistic mechanics]] (differential geometry to assign coordinates a non-Euclidean plane). = 3 dimensions to describe the central point of an object: x, y, and z are all mutually perpendicular to each other.

###### Orientation of an Object 
There are 3 angles needed to describe orientation:

What is mass? 
> In deep space where we can ignore gravity, is it possible to tell how massive things are? If so, how can you tell?

###### Start Simple: Understand Motion of Solid Object
- Step 1: Mathematical description of possible configurations to evolution of system 
	- How can we mathematically represent the location and orientation of a solid object?

- Step 2: Represent motion

	 ![[Pasted image 20240920112518.png]]
	 * This is only possible if there is some sort of standard time interval - dropping a ball from a certain height, pendulum/ SHM system etc.
