Books: 
📔 The Oxford Solid State Basics (by S. H. Simon): 10/10! This book introduces solid state physics very pedagogically and gives a soft introduction to advanced topics like the reciprocal space. The book has funny anecdotes in the footnotes, and I really recommend the online lecture series “The Oxford Solid State Basics” on YouTube.  
  
📔 Mathematical Methods for Physicists (by Arfken & Weber): 8/10. I had this book in my applied maths course for physicists, and since we only read parts of the book it was difficult to grasp everything, since the book is both long and dense.  
  
📔 Concepts in Thermal Physics (by Blundell & Blundell): 9/10. This book I had for my thermodynamics course, and it was overall a good book with fun exercises.  
  
📔 Introduction to Electrodynamics (by David J. Griffths): 9.5/10. This book is a classic in electromagnetism. It is very rigid (David Griffith’s books are in general very good) and has really great exercises. If you devote yourself to studying the book closely, you get REALLY good at electromagnetism.  
  
📔 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (by D. J. Griffiths): 10/10. My favourite quantum mechanics book! It’s a great place to start your QM journey.  
  
📔 Quantum Mechanics — A Modern Development (by Ballentine) 10/10. A very dense, but very instructive, book building on top of “Introduction to QM”.
