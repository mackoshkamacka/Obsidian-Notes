### Individual
#### Personality
- Big 5; OCEAN = Most academically recognized; kind of vanilla, doesn't say much about subject.
- Myers-Briggs = Most recognized casually; not a fan.
- Enneagram = Best for personal development; great for getting a general sense of a person's background/reason for behavior - with increased specificity with wings, instinctual variants, stresses etc. model becomes too convoluted; pseudoscientific. 
- Attitudinal Psyche = Best for first impressions; placing people's behaviors beyond some trauma. Creates the best archetypes in my opinion. 
- Socionics = idk yet.
- Temperaments = OGs; Best for better understanding classical literature - similar to Freud in a sense. Instinctual variants
#### Emotions 
27 distinct emotions: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1702247114
